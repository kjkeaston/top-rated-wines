"Heitz has made this stellar rosé from the rare Grignolino grape since 1961. Ruby grapefruit-red, it's sultry with strawberry, watermelon, orange zest and salty spice flavor, highlighted with vibrant floral aromas.",95,24,California,Napa Valley,Rosé
"There's a lot to like in this nicely priced white, a blend of several regional vineyards. A taste of hazelnut expands on the palate to meet creamy Tahitian vanilla. Approachably round, this crowd-pleasing wine finishes in measured, integrated oak.",90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"While exuberantly fruity, almost tropical on the nose, there's a crystalline edge to this dry Riesling that renders it especially refreshing. It's vibrant and light footed, brightened by a lingering honey note on the finish.",90,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Massively fruity, this is an apple/pear bonanza, fleshy and almost lasciviously delicious. The huge fruit flavors convey an impression of sweetness, though this is not identified as off dry. It has tremendous density and length.",91,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"This wine over-delivers in quality for the price. It's made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blended in to good effect. The whole combines into layers of chocolate and graham cracker, dappled in vanilla and jam. Thick tannins suggest a swirl or two of the glass. The finish is all tobacco.",91,28,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"From a multiplicity of vineyards, this wine works and is a tremendous value for the price. It mixes hot mulled-cider spices, cinnamon, clove and pine forest, conveying surprising depth. Plum, dark cherry and more clove lead to a powerful, leathery finish.",91,22,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.",91,20,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir
"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat.",90,26,California,Amador County,Barbera
"This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love. Lemon peel, apple skin and pear play together well, never becoming distracting, but instead integrating well with one another and the light hint of oak. Food friendly, it's also a great deal.",90,16,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
"A sublime twist of citrus lies at the heart of this light yet complex white, which is refreshing and layered with a subtle bite of underlying oak. From a dry-farmed vineyard maintained by the same family for 30 years, this whole-cluster pressed wine was given time in a majority of stainless steel and neutral French oak. It shines in moderate acidity and tropical flair.",90,28,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors.",90,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Grenache
"Estate grown and aged in Stainless steel, this racy and pungent wine is packed with rich, juicy fruit flavors. Apple, lemon-lime and tangerine are in the mix, showing that Chardonnay does not always need oak flavors to have real power.",90,26,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Chardonnay
"Clean, sharp and zesty fruit blossom aromas meet with ripe pomelo and green apple scents on the nose of this wine by Steve Dooley. A fresh, tingling acidity shows on the sip, which is a tad sour with stone fruit skins but bountiful in a slate-driven minerality and grippy texture. Cool climate Albariño has much promise in the state.",90,24,California,Edna Valley,Albariño
"This most intriguing white grape, which the Larners grow as an ode to their Italian past, shows a sweet nose with a bone dry palate. Sugary citrus scents of orange blossoms and peach syrup give way to a brisk palate full of honeysuckle, night jasmine and a nearly pine needle bitterness that cuts dynamically through it all.",90,28,California,Ballard Canyon,Malvasia Bianca
"The hue is an elegant peach just starting to blush with pink. The wine is entirely dry, with low alcohol framing intricate flavors of peaches, limes and vanilla, brightened by crisp acidity.",91,20,California,Napa Valley,Pinot Noir
"A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility.",91,22,California,Knights Valley,Syrah
"One of the few in California to use this grape, winemaker Ryan Pease makes a great case for more in this bottling, which shows broad lemon curd, soft apple flesh and Anjou pear on the nose. There is ripe stone fruit on the tangy palate, but it's bone dry and grippy with chalky texture.",90,27,California,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Ugni Blanc
"Much like its companion from the Revelation & Sorek Bloc, this offers well-endowed flavors of melon and white peach, along with a touch of citrus. There is a sense of higher acidity, along with lower listed alcohol, rather counter-intuitive as this is the reserve. Pick either one and you'll be pleased.",90,29,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Grüner Veltliner
This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price. Fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by herb-tinged tannins. The immaculate craftsmanship and clean direct flavors are light years beyond budget Pinot Noir from most other regions. This is your perfect salmon wine.,90,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"An ambitious, concentrated, but not oaky wine, this has a very dark color, aromas of black cherries, and ripe but dry flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate. It is medium to full bodied, framed by lots of fine-grained tannins and finishing with more dark fruit. It's a good wine to lay down and drink after 2019.",90,15,California,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering.",90,24,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"Grippy leather and tobacco provide a gravelly texture and burly nature to this medium-bodied wine, which finds its groove in the glass. Concentrated and dense, it offers smoother elements of black currant, cassis and leather on the finish.",90,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The nose on this creative blend of 52% Gewürztraminer, 25% Sauvignon Blanc and 23% Chenin Blanc is quite showy with peach, baked orange, apple blossom and honeysuckle notes. But the real star is the palate that is racy with sizzling energy and flavors of cut grass, lemongrass and sour-apple peels.",90,20,California,Santa Ynez Valley,White Blend
"A minuscule amount of this wine was made, all of it fermented entirely in stainless steel. The result is lively in mouthcoating acidity and refreshing swirls of light-bodied mandarin orange and lime.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Tropical guava and mango surround a restrained cradling of French oak, only 15% of it new, in this easy-to-like, approachable wine. Wrappings of vanilla and honeysuckle complete the picture, with a straightforward, relatively lengthy finish.",90,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"This flavorful and beautifully contoured wine is simply delicious. It has a lightly spicy aroma, plenty of fresh red-cherry and plum flavors, moderate acidity and tannins, and medium body.",90,22,California,Lodi,Tempranillo
"This is a classic version of the varietal, matching complex herb and cherry aromas with fresh, frank fruit flavors that also show hints of mint, clove and anise. It is all about vibrancy and balance, not full body, and has a welcome, appetizing personality.",90,24,California,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc
"An interesting vein of tasty herb flavor runs through this full-bodied, plump and fruity wine. The aroma has hints of dill and sage, and these mingle with black cherry and blueberry on the palate. A sleek texture and long finish complete the picture.",90,20,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"Quite a steal of a deal for a widely available wine, this shows cinnamon, red cherry, ripe cranberry, light tobacco and a touch of leather on the rustic nose. Once sipped, the mouthfeel is soft, offering flavors of cranberry and red cherry that are spiced by thyme, bay leaf and more cinnamon.",90,23,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir
"This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"This full-bodied wine combines deep, ripe fruit flavors, light spicy accents and a very firm mouthfeel that begs for a bite of a grilled rosemary lamb chop. The wine pushes the stereotype of wimpy Merlot out of the way and does it with fruit concentration rather than obvious oak. Drink through 2020.",90,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Merlot
"An ambitious, concentrated, but not oaky wine, this has a very dark color, aromas of black cherries, and ripe but dry flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate. It is medium to full bodied, framed by lots of fine-grained tannins and finishing with more dark fruit. It's a good wine to lay down and drink after 2019.",90,15,California,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This estate-grown, organic Chardonnay is a terrific value, detailed and brightly fruity, with precise angles and spicy details. The apple/pear/pineapple fruit flavors are crisply defined, perfectly ripe, and beautifully balanced.",91,20,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
"From the estate vineyard, this is thick with spicy flavors of fresh-cut pear. There's a hint of butter and a slightly minty aspect. All in all it's complex, rich and inviting, with penetrating acidity.",91,26,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Gris
"This Chardonnay is rich in all the bells and whistles, such as aging on the lees in French oak barrels. The underlying fruit shows ripe, racy tropical flavors, as well as peach and pear notes that are deep and delicious. With production of 8,400 cases, the wine should be easy to find.",91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Stainless-steel fermented, this wine remains pungently aromatic in woody, earthy tones, with accents of fragrant orange blossom and pear, while staying crisp and light on the palate. Honey and lemon combine on the complex finish.",90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Though 28 g/L of residual sugar is indicated, this lushly fruity and thoroughly delicious wine does not seem at all sweet, and just barely off dry. Peaches and pears combine in a lightly spicy but intensely flavorful wine with a myriad of food pairing possibilities, notably Thai noodle dishes, or poultry with a fruit sauce.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Gewürztraminer
"This 100% Dijon-clone bottling offers a bold mix of peach, banana and pineapple. It's fruit-driven from top to bottom, with supporting acids to keep it fresh and invigorating.",90,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"Ripe bramble and smoked nuts cast a savory edge to concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors in this robust wine. It's velvety and rich, but crisp, cranberry acidity and a granite edge lend elegance. Drink now through 2022.",90,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
"Rich, ripe streaks of black cherry preserve are balanced by savory nuances of dried herb, toast and bramble in this luscious Pinot Noir. Aptly “lusty” in style, it's deeply concentrated with an unabashed fruit-forwardness, but crisp cranberry acidity and a penetrating earthiness gives it marked composure.",90,27,New York,Finger Lakes,Pinot Noir
"Hailing from Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this wine brings black currant, huckleberry and dark plum aromas that smell pure and sweet. The black fruit and smoke flavors display a mixture of concentration and restraint.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"Tangy and intensely vibrant in citrus, this site-specific white sings in grapefruit pith and zest, layering those flavors atop spicy ginger and herb. It finishes bright and fresh on the palate, eager for food.",90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Chocolaty aromas and ample spicy, dark-fruit flavors power this generous and firm-textured wine. Everything seems in place and in balance, ready to take on a nice roast or braise.",90,15,California,Dunnigan Hills,Tempranillo
"This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry.",90,25,California,Oak Knoll District,Riesling
"Opulent blackberry aromas and a mouthful of jammy, grapey but dry fruit flavors put a lot of oomph into this focused, concentrated and well-balanced wine. It is just tart and tannic enough to pair easily with rich food, and those same qualities should help it mellow with age through 2020.",90,28,California,Mendocino County,Negroamaro
"This full-bodied and densely textured wine has a deep color, aromas like wood smoke and blackberries, and flavors that saturate the palate with berries, clove and dark chocolate notes. It's bold in body, has plenty of tannins for grip, and a lingering, rich finish.",90,22,California,Amador County,Mourvèdre
"A winning combination of seductive, spicy aromas and generous, well-developed fruit flavors make this wine hard to resist. It is full-bodied, dry and quite full-flavored, but without overdoing anything, so it's well balanced.",90,26,California,Sierra Foothills,Barbera
"Generous fruit and spice flavors and a full, chewy mouthfeel make this an appetizing wine to pair with big food. It smells like black cherries, tastes ripe and berry-like and has accents of cinnamon and cardamom. The texture is supportive and lightly astringent, with fine tannins.",90,28,California,Amador County,Tempranillo
"While relatively full-bodied and tannic, this wine also has friendly, fresh berry and cherry flavors that are held in place by very firm acidity and tannins. It feels and tastes generous but also strong and taut, so it should improve with a little time. Best to drink now through 2020.",90,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Syrah

The palate is greeted with minerality that fades into an apple butter flavor alongside a pinch of cinnamon, culminating in a graceful vanilla finish.",92,27,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
"A stellar wine at Kiona for decades, this includes 11% Gewürztraminer in the blend, and is finished at 83 g/L residual sugar.

The balance, acidity, length and texture are spot on.",92,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"An aromatically vibrant wine with notes of slate, peach, apricot and citrus. It drinks off dry, with exquisitely balanced acidity and a lot of depth and richness to the fruit flavors. Impressive stuff.",92,21,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Riesling
"This is the first vintage for this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Sangiovese. Ripe, lush and complex, it offers flavors of plum and cassis, with an appealing texture and moderately gripping tannins. There's life and snap to the finish, and though it's already delicious just two years after the vintage, another year or two of bottle age should see it continue to improve.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"This feral and gamy wine shows roast lamb, rosemary, dried fennel, rose petal and forest floor aromas on its dynamic nose. The palate leads with explosive acidity, before waves of Concord grape and blackberry flavor take hold. It's light on its feet but has some textural firmness, finishing on rosemary, lavender and game notes.",93,28,California,San Luis Obispo,Syrah
"Clean, crisp and bright, this was fermented in stainless (with just 10% in neutral wood), and not put through malolactic.

It's easy to imagine on the table with a grilled rib eye.",90,20,California,Mendocino County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Winemakers Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli are the first to admit that this is an odd style of wine, but people are digging the pét-nat style. Aromas of sour apple, grass and passion fruit arise while the palate's very tight, bubbles unleash exotic tropical fruits like green papaya and green banana.",90,28,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
"Quince, lemon peel and honeydew make for compatible bedfellows in this no-oak white, which is light and inviting on the palate, with more underlying herbal flourishes than it first lets on. Dry and daring, it'll pair well with all manner of fresh seafood.",90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

"This bright and fruity Beaujolais-style wine is as light and refreshing as a young wine can possibly be. It delivers a smile-inducing burst of strawberry and cherry fruit—round, ripe and juicy. You absolutely want to drink this sometime in 2016 while all that youthful energy remains.",90,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir

"From vineyards in both Alexander Valley and Bennett Valley, the grapes were fermented in French oak for eight months, a minority of it new. This is a medium-bodied, integrated wine rich in caramel apple and fresh-squeezed tangerine. Brisk and in balance, it finishes with a note of toasted almond.",90,26,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
"This wine has hints of cedar and coriander, a luxurious, velvety and appropriately tannic texture, and flavors that are ripe and delicious. Its personality seems confident, well balanced and well behaved, but strong and focused.",90,24,California,Sierra Foothills,Malbec
"The first of the vintage to be tasted from the region, this bottling is a promising sign. Fresh-cut green apples, Anjou pear skins, honeydew, bubblegum, wet stone and whiffs of cut grass show on the nose. There's lots of verve to the palate, with white pepper, apple skin and slight jalapeño flavors. It's perfect for shellfish and salads.",90,16,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc

The creamy palate conveys boysenberry and blackberry seasoned by lavender and white pepper.",90,20,California,Central Coast,Red Blend
"Lusciously ripe mango and lychee aromas introduce this unusually sprightly Gewürztraminer. Perfumed and delicately sweet, but not at all cloying, it's vivacious and thirst quenching, finishing on a enticingly astringent tea-leaf note. Drink now through 2018.",90,18,New York,Seneca Lake,Gewürztraminer
"This lovely wine captures the floral, perfumed essence of the grape in a restrained, sippable style. It's dry and crisp, with lemony fruit and the delicate sensation that you are drinking fresh flowers.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Although this wine is listed as a white blend, the producer says the variety is Vernaccia, not found often in California. Light in alcohol and approach, it opens in a bouquet of waxy apple and Meyer lemon, followed by a medium-powered palate of pear. The finish is crisp and lean.",90,26,California,Carneros,White Blend

"This is a creamy, thick and food friendly white with highlights of honey and green apple and a lingering decadence of ginger, just hinting at anise. Medium-bodied, it represents the vintage and the appellation well, at a price that's nice.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

A streak of ginger runs through racy acidity.",90,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Sparkling Blend
"This falls sbetween a rosé and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing.

A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish.",90,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris

"This is one of the vintage's knockout rosés, thanks in part to the Grenache and Gamay grapes that make up the blend.

"This is one of famed Pinot Noir winemaker Lane Tanner's first stabs at this grape, and she succeeds strongly in this brand with business partner Will Henry. Aromas of cherry, bark, mint candy, dried rose petal and sagebrush give way to an inviting berry pie flavor, followed by a slowly emergent herbal grip that's reminiscent of pine sap.",92,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache
"This is the first reserve Pinot Gris from the winery—half fermented in stainless, half in barrel. The wine feels as if it's very lightly oxidized, with dusty, tawny apple flavors that recall a good hard cider. Its power is in the persistent, bone dry finish, that never quits. Drink now through 2018.",91,26,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Gris
"Ken Wright produces as many as a dozen or more single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine is blended from many of those same sites, whose vines were often planted back in the 1980s. It's light and elegant, yet powerfully flavorful, with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit pushing deep into the palate. It's clean and fresh, with crisp defining acidity, perfect balance, refined tannins and a long finish. Best of all, it's widely available.",91,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"This Chardonnay from Dan Kessler and Ellen Haak-Kessler is a blend of of clones 95 and 76, featuring tangerine, pear, and chamomile on the nose. The palate is framed by tension and bright acidity, opening up to riper flavors of peach and melon, with a hint of sea salt.",91,29,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"This contends for the best $10 Riesling in the country. It's off dry, with 30g/L of residual sugar, but not too sweet for some Asian noodle entrées. The mouthfeel is thick and borders on syrupy, with penetrating flavors of mango, papaya and peaches. It could also be served after dinner with fruit and soft cheeses.",91,10,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"Jumping out of the glass with intoxicating aromas of cracked cherry cordials, this wine comes from the small production of Robin Bogue, whose father, Bill Bogue, is a well-known vineyard consultant. Flavors start with grilled meatiness, slowly slip to licorice on the midpalate and finish between vanilla and leather. Altogether a richly nuanced and deeply luscious wine.",93,29,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah
"Elegant on the nose, it offers aromas settling between violet, white pepper and chai tea. The 5% Petite Sirah adds a nice touch of viscosity to the palate. The flavors range from cinnamon to licorice with nice bitterness and acidity, making the fruits of plum and prune almost an afterthought.",93,24,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
"Oak powers the nose on this entry-level bottling from the Ballard Canyon-based winery, with peach custard, cinnamon and other brown spices. It's wide and ripe on the palate at first, with cooked Meyer lemons, nectarine and pineapple, but also boasts a line of brisker acidity trending toward lime.",91,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Tart with melon, peach and lemon fruits, this was crafted in a mix of stainless and new French oak. Low alcohol notwithstanding, it drinks dry despite some residual sugar.",91,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"This vineyard-designated Viognier is light and lithe in focused apricot and wet stone minerality. A wisp of a wine, it's light in texture and weight yet lingers memorably on the palate, with flavors of stone fruit and soft spice that carry through to the long finish.",91,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Viognier
"This pioneering Alsatian-inspired winery always amazes with this distinctive and approachable bottling. Bright botanical aromas of mandarin orange rind, honeysuckle and pear give way to a zesty palate full of preserved citrus and marmalade flavors, all set against a firm structure and racy acidity. The finish—which is bone dry—opens with nectarine notes, then sails off with a flash of herbs.",91,22,California,Central Coast,Gewürztraminer
"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer.",92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Starting off with grapefruit soda and apple-pear cider aromas, this well-priced Chardonnay is made by the Miller family of Bien Nacido Vineyard fame in honor of the brand's late founder. It features the steadily evolving flavor profile of wines twice its price. The citrus soda element is first, followed by a distinct, slightly bitter pear-peel profile on the midpalate, finishing with lingering vanilla toffee.",92,20,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"A consistently lovely selection, L'Ecole's Old Vines Chenin Blanc captures the grape's floral highlights and its complex fruit flavors of peach, melon and citrus. It lingers gracefully with a rich, slightly oily mouthfeel.",92,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chenin Blanc
"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts. There is nuttiness, brioche and slightly sour orange on the nose, followed by a very soft mouthfeel, with flavors of pound cake, vanilla cookie, peach cobbler and candied grapefruit.",92,23,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
"Fresh in peach with an herbal, savory edge, this wine begs to be analyzed and enjoyed over many sips. From the colder reaches of the Russian River Valley's smaller Green Valley area, it's Alsatian in its crispness and linear intensity, clean and long-lingering in lemon zest.",92,25,California,Green Valley,Pinot Blanc
"A light-bodied take on the variety, this wine imparts shocks of sage, lavender and mint aromas over a landscape of black and white pepper and dried herb flavors.",91,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Syrah
"This is a steal of a wine, tart and satisfying in its crispness of pine needle, cranberry and pomegranate flavors, and well-crafted in every way. Texturally integrated, it offers approachability within a complex, layered package, lingering on the finish with a tease of cola.",91,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"This wine is big and bold, but its opulent, generous fruit flavors perfectly fill out its frame, giving it the balance it needs for enjoyment. Ripe blackberry and black cherry notes mark the palate, unfettered by oak-inflected flavor. The texture is firm with lots of fine-grained tannins, while the fruit lingers nicely on the finish.",91,16,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel
"This captures all the ripe fruit and fresh mouthfeel you could ask for in a young Riesling. Succulent and peachy, with references to other mixed tree fruits, this also brings highlights of orange pekoe tea. Residual sugar is 20 g/L.",91,16,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Riesling
"Production is only about one-tenth as much as the Willamette Valley cuvée. For a couple bucks more you get a tight, less opulently fruity wine, with compact skin flavors over-riding fruit flesh. Hints of apple, pear and peach accompany a streak of minerality, and the persistence suggests that this will age nicely. Drink 2020 through 2026.",91,22,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Gris
"This single-vineyard selection is full-bodied and exuberantly rich. It captures the power of Klipsun/Red Mountain fruit, with a lush array of candied orange, citrus and papaya. There's a touch of sugar, excellent length and a lingering hint of honeycomb.",92,19,Washington,Red Mountain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Glazed apple and pineapple sorbet frame the nose on this offering from Central Coast veteran Stephen Ross Dooley, who makes his wine in one of San Luis Obispo's only urban wineries. The wine is very full and soft on the palate, with round, traditional Chardonnay flavors and a satisfying balance between ripe, rich fruit and lingering acidity. The finishing flavors feel more oak-derived than acidity-fueled.",92,24,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"Not overly full-bodied, not overly ripe, not overly wild, but just right for dinner time. It's well balanced, velvet textured and multilayered. Brambly, bright raspberry and blackberry flavors fill the mouth, supported by smooth tannins and good acidity that keep it lively and appetizing through the long finish.",92,19,California,Mendocino,Zinfandel
"This bottling slips in many corners of the flavor experience at once. On the nose, a bit of tropical fruit mixes with evenly spread buttercream, followed by precursor hints of bright acidity on the palate. That citrus-led vibrancy does come, as does a mix of creaminess and limestone-inflected tang, as if the rocks themselves delivered the acidity.",92,26,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"Chalk, apricot honey and wisps of gasoline lead the aroma profile on this wine from electronic music DJ David deLaski and his wife, Anna. The couple have been making wine since 2012 with the help of Steve Clifton (of Brewer-Clifton & Palmina wines). On the palate, there is strong mandarin orange-driven acidity and remnants of the chalkiness, which together should give the wine aging potential. Drink today or buy a case and try every year to track what will be an insightful evolution.",92,26,California,Santa Barbara County,Riesling
"One of the “12 Zins of Lodi 2014,” it was chosen in a judging by the Lodi Winegrape Commission to represent the region's finest. The deep red-black color is saturated to the rim. Deep, evocative aromas lead to ripe cherry, boysenberry, chocolate and nutmeg flavors that echo on the finish. The texture is full and smooth.",92,15,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
"This estate-grown, pure varietal effort is exceptionally rich and succulent. The flavors of sugared grapefruit, lemon pulp and rind and sweet tea are concentrated and lingering. Despite the impression of sweetness, it's not a dessert wine, just an especially ripe and rich one.",90,24,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Viognier
"Classic flavors of pear flesh, along with a touch of Poire William liqueur, are the highlights here. It's a stylish, clean and persistent wine, that should be enjoyed within a couple of years of the vintage.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Full of berry and spice aromas, this wine is full-bodied, dry, and grippingly tannic in texture, offering ripe blackberry and raspberry flavors that match its big structure. Gutsy and concentrated, it's made from estate-grown fruit.",90,20,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"Deep color, bold fruit aromas and substantial, spicy flavors lend significant power and concentration to this full-bodied wine. It's nearly dry, well structured and balanced, with appealing blackberry, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors.",90,22,California,Dunnigan Hills,Red Blend
"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs. It's thirst-quenching and clean in texture, with a fruit-driven acidity that reverberates on the finish.",90,14,California,Mendocino,Sauvignon Blanc
"This full-bodied and complex wine has loads of personality. An exotic, slightly earthy aroma leads to fruity richness and good viscosity on the palate, with a creamy texture and wonderful sense of layering.",90,18,California,Clarksburg,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers.",92,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"This wine features a Grenache/Mourvèdre/Counoise blend (a GMC?), and the three grapes combine beautifully. Sweet berry, clean earth and a touch of minerality are supported by firm acidity. The wine rounds out in the mouth, and continues into a lingering, caramel-streaked finish.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Earthy and inviting with wild raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors, this fruity, light-bodied wine also allows room for rose petal and forest notes. Tart and peppery, it finishes with rhubarb accents.",90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"From veteran Crawford Malone, this bottling delivers appetizing aromas of honeycomb and Key lime pie. The honeyed citrus flavors persist onto the flavorful palate, finishing with a touch of honeydew melon. It's great right now, but also shows potential for holding until 2016 or more in the cellar.",92,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Rhône-style White Blend
"The wildness and heat of Zinfandel are restrained to good effect in this elegant, supple but concentrated version. Aromas and flavors of raspberry and black cherry lead to cinnamon and clove on the tasty finish, which lasts a long time. Should pair well with most meats and with tomato-based sauces.",91,20,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
"From the Monte Lago Vineyard in Lake County's High Valley AVA, this blend of 68% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 12% Syrah is dark and brooding, offering dusty tannins around roasted plum and strawberry notes. Soft and intense, with bright acidity, a taste of licorice lurks up to the leathery, espresso-laden finish.",91,20,California,High Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend
"A lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol.",91,24,California,San Benito County,Zinfandel
"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs. It's thirst-quenching and clean in texture, with a fruit-driven acidity that reverberates on the finish.",90,14,California,Mendocino,Sauvignon Blanc
"This full-bodied and complex wine has loads of personality. An exotic, slightly earthy aroma leads to fruity richness and good viscosity on the palate, with a creamy texture and wonderful sense of layering.",90,18,California,Clarksburg,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe fruit meets butter and spice in this medium-bodied, smooth and integrated wine. It opens with Bosc pear and golden apple aromas, melding with vanilla and marzipan notes, its richness of flavor nicely buoyed up by acidity.",90,14,California,Mendocino County,Chardonnay
"This wine shows crisp apple and pear notes over a backdrop of minerality. Its ripe fruit is ribbed with anise, fennel and lemongrass scents.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"This wine shows crisp apple and pear notes over a backdrop of minerality. Its ripe fruit is ribbed with anise, fennel and lemongrass scents.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"This Chardonnay is striking in its ability to convey marshmallow roasting over a campfire. It's full-bodied and lush, its rich fruit core of apple and pear seemingly dressed in clarified butter. That richness, however, doesn't weigh down the palate; it finishes with refinement.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Exotic in orange blossom and jasmine scents, this wine presents as full bodied, brawny and rich, showing a touch of oak reduction on the palate. Within that framework, hints of lemon and grapefruit keep it feeling fresh.",90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This marks another stunning vintage for this blend of 55% Sémillon, 25% Muscadelle, 10% Palomino and 10% Colombard, made by Zin master Mike Officer. Pungent in pear and pineapple, it has cutting-edge minerality, a taste of slate, and remains at turns creamy and crisp on the palate. This wine is unusual in all the right ways yet triumphantly delicious.",95,28,California,Sonoma County,White Blend
"This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used. The barrel treatment takes it away from any ordinary Riesling characteristics, yielding a wine that has much in common with Viognier—floral and buttery, with substantial alcohol.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Tart aromas—both familiar like green apple and more obscure like mustard—comprise the nose on this estate offering. On the palate, the flavors are surprisingly luscious and ripe for such an intriguing nose, led by pineapple and finishing with a touch of sour orange and, again, tart apple.",91,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"Sourced from a well-chosen group of top vineyards, this Bordeaux-style blend is nicely focused with a crisp mix of raspberry and cherry fruit flavors. The supporting acidity and overall freshness, in spite of the extra bottle age, suggests that this may be cellared until 2019 or longer.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Kathie Lee Gifford teams with Monterey County's Scheid Vineyards for this wine, which features 42% Merlot, 25% Petite Sirah, 12% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot. There's a mix of iron, coffee and crushed, dried violet on the Old World-leaning nose. The herbal elegance continues on the palate, with dried oregano seasoning the dark black and blue fruit elements.",91,20,California,Monterey,Red Blend
"Big, bold and concentrated, this full-bodied wine was given the complete new-barrel, lees-stirring treatment. It has a deep gold color, with ripe pear and buttered toast aromas that transition to waves of pear and apple on the palate and lingering finish.",91,20,California,Sierra Foothills,Chardonnay
"This full-flavored, richly textured wine offers impressions of plum, black cherry and dark chocolate shavings. It's big and broad on the palate, with a light layer of tannins and loads of easy-going enjoyment.",90,22,California,Red Hills Lake County,Grenache
"Here's another super value from this under-the-radar producer. It's viscous and mouth filling, with lush pear and apple fruit. The concentration and fruit purity is exceptional.",90,12,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"From old vines within the Fanucchi Wood Road Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this is a rare bottling of a variety more commonly found in the Jura, but acquiring new fans in California, especially made at this high level. Creamy and round, it remains fresh on the palate in a lemon-swirled minerality that provides a savory edge of ginger.",93,26,California,Russian River Valley,Trousseau Gris
"The nose on this well-priced appellation blend by Brian Loring has it all: golden honey, caramel apple, supple peach flesh, pressed white flowers, fresh yellow flowers and even quinine. The apple-flesh flavors show oak influence in hints of butterscotch and pineapple, yet the mouthwatering acidity keeps it all in balance.",93,24,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"Made from both grapes directly pressed into wine as well as bled off, this crisply complex offering is springtime in a glass, a soft and supple evoking of fresh-cut pineapple that remains dry and delicious without ever overreaching. Medium in body, with a hint of dried herb on the back palate, it offers structure and just the right amount of weight.",93,20,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"This aromatic, Bordeaux-style blend is built from a generous mix of well-loved vineyards scattered across the Columbia Valley. Balanced and detailed, it combines fresh herbs, rhubarb, raspberry and tart acidity. The result is a young, still tight, well-structured wine with excellent aging potential through 2024.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"At first, the nose on this refreshing blend of Grenache Blanc, Rousanne, Viognier and Marsanne is ethereal, but then it centralizes on white peach with a touch of vanilla and buttercream. It hits the palate with a zing, delivering banana-cream tropicality and some bitterness, cinching up a bit on the finish. It would go well with a picnic of cheese, charcuterie and fresh bread.",91,24,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style White Blend
"Light in color, this blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise—all aged in neutral French oak—brings notes of red fruit, herbs and spices. Supported by chalky tannins, it has a mesmerizing texture and purity that carries through to a lingering finish.",91,24,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Red Blend
"This Bordeaux-style blend is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and 34% Cabernet Franc. Some 20% saw new French oak, and the wine has lovely concentration and flavor integration. Blueberry, blackberry and cassis are wrapped in cacao and coffee—thoroughly luscious and nicely concentrated.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Peach-blush in color, this is a light, lean wine, gorgeous in citrus and wet stone minerality. Layers of strawberry and watermelon linger on the tongue throughout the crisp finish. Open and enjoy whenever you need a hit of summer.",91,25,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"This tiny Oregon winery sourced Yakima Valley fruit for this wine. Though many West Coast producers take a stab at this Italian grape, most settle for a faux “Super Tuscan,” highly oaked style. This is closer to Chianti Classico, with strawberry and cherry fruit, good acidity and light herbal highlights.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese
"A ripe and tasty style of Zinfandel from a grand old name in the Sierra Foothills. The maple and brown sugar tones from new oak integrate well with ripe but not overripe fruit flavors. Touches of clove and black pepper come out as you sip, adding welcome nuances.",91,20,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"This bottling, sourced from the popular Tondre's Grapefield, is imbued with the scents and tastes of passionfruit. Fleeting spearmint and picked pear characters also arise on the nose, while apple tart flavors emerge midpalate. But passionfruit rules the day, and that's not a bad thing at all.",91,27,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"Very, very few wineries make pure varietal Counoise, and none any better than this outstanding example. Tasting a bit like Grenache, a bit like Pinot Noir, but different from either, this fresh wine bursts with berries and tongue-tickling acidity. A hint of vanilla cream runs through the finish.",91,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Counoise
"Scents of butterscotch candies, vanilla custard, apple mousse and sea salt greet the nose in a subtle manner on this wine by Steve Clifton. The palate is framed with bright acidity and tight minerality, with almonds and pecans slowly emerging toward a dynamic finish of white truffle and nectarine. It's a very intriguing, lovely wine.",93,22,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Tocai Friulano
"An aromatic wine with abundant notes of ripe white peach, apricot, mineral and flowers. It drinks off dry (10.7 g/L residual sugar) with a pleasing sense of tension between the acid and stone fruit flavors leading to a long, persistent finish.",91,18,Washington,Ancient Lakes,Riesling
"An unabashed California Chardonnay with buttery aromas, sunny fruit flavors of ripe pear and peach, and a lingering finish that hints at vanilla and cream. Fresh acidity and a light touch of oak keep the texture lively and refresh the palate. FEL is a cool-climate line of wines from Napa's Lede Family Wines.",91,28,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay
"There's a slightly pink hue to this wine from Lompoc's Norman Yost. The nose is bright and minerally, with strawberry, apple cider and slight watermelon aromas. There's even more going on once sipped, with pear spritzer and citrus zest playing along with gray rocks and elements both bitter and sour. It's a refreshing take on a grape that doesn't always get the rock star treatment.",91,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Gris
"A blend of seven grapes—a mix of Bordeaux and Rhône varieties—this is a delicious mash-up, showcasing vivid, forward, spicy berry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity come highlights of dark chocolate and clean earth.",91,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Wine industry veteran Crawford Malone turns the attention of his brand, which is named after a pruning knife, to a Syrah-Grenache-Petite Sirah blend of varying vintages. This starts with roasted fennel and wildfire scents, but then the prettier rose petals aromas of the Grenache emerge. It's very soft, almost massaging on the tongue. The complex flavors bounce between herbs and flowers and fruit, corresponding almost exactly to the characters of the three components.",91,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Rhône-style Red Blend
"At first, there's a slight green herb funkiness of sharp dill on the nose of this single-vineyard offering from the Jackson Family-owned Cambria brand, where Santa Maria native Denise Shurtleff has made the wine since 1999. Once sipped, that evolves into a nice smokiness that sits atop tart green apple and Asian pear.",91,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"Packaged in a sexy, Champagne-style bottle, this 100% Grenache is firm and substantial. It underscores fruit flavors of peach, apricot and melon with appealing minerality.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Rosé
"A blend of Sangiovese (70%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it brings an abundance of sweet barrel notes of vanilla, coconut and baking spices along with earth tones and dried cherries. The fruit flavors are ripe and sweet, backed by firm tannins and tart acidity.",91,29,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Red Blend
"This estate-grown offering was a standout among several dozen tasted for a feature story. It's loaded with bright fruit flavors of grapefruit and pear, and even in the warm 2012 vintage, it maintains the grape's signature minerality, while moving gracefully into a detailed, focused finish.",92,18,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Blanc
"This is a crisp and bracing wine, that pops with bright citrus and wet stone flavors. It's fully ripe, but leans toward greener flavors, with accents of cucumber and celery. The freshness and outstanding palate presence suggest drinking this wine within a couple of years of release.",90,18,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Here is a well-priced example of the outstanding 2014 Oregon Pinots. Black cherry and pomegranate fruits make for a juicy fresh fruit-driven palate. There's a touch of cola and caffè latte as well. It's seen 20% new French oak, to good effect.",90,26,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"A steal for its price, this wine is refreshingly quaffable, with a sublimely textured palate of preserved lemon and nectarine. It's both lush and surprisingly complex.",90,15,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc

"Round dark strawberry, mulberry and pound cake aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from winemaker Eric Laumann. Bright raspberry and strawberry fruits show on the palate, lifted by sage and bay leaf notes and framed by a structure of mouth-cleansing tannins.",90,22,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir
"This wine is impressive in its full-bodied approach to the variety, allowing it ample expression of garrigue and gamy bacon scents. Layered acidity keeps it from feeling overly dense and ripe, ending on a smoky oak note.",90,19,California,Los Carneros,Syrah
"Roughly half estate-grown Tempranillo, this smooth and deeply-fruited red includes small amounts of 10 other grapes. For all that it's complete, complex and composed, with pomegranate jam, loganberries, polished tannins and prolonged power. Drink now through 2020.",90,18,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Red Blend
"Very little Auxerrois is grown in Oregon, and the earliest plantings, the owners note, were here at Zenith. This could be mistaken for a Chardonnay, with ripe melon, peach and banana fruit matched to rounded out flavors of butter and caramel. It was barrel fermented and put through malolactic, much like a fine Chardonnay.",90,27,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Auxerrois
"This standout blend—the best from this winery to date—is 68% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot.

The café au lait flavors are silky soft and concentrated, framed by bright acidity and showing an exquisite sense of balance and texture that carries through the lingering finish.",92,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Earthy cherry and wild strawberry notes form the core of this deep, concentrated and yet not overly dense wine. Herbal and teasingly tart as it shifts from midpalate to finish, it offers a last splash of nutmeg on the finale.",92,27,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir
"Delicate layers of smoke, vanilla and spice lavish this textured Chardonnay that's remarkably light on its feet. Fermentation in a variety of oak barrels lends nuance to bright apple, pear and honeysuckle notes on the palate and mouthfeel that's rich, creamy and round. Brisk acidity cuts through the finish.",91,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay
"Gewürztraminer doesn't get any more floral and spicy than this. Exuberantly aromatic, it conveys a sensuous perfume of baby powder, rose petals and lavender. The floral characteristics continue in the mouth, yielding a long, intense, detailed and unique wine. Sip it chilled and have fun experimenting with food matches!",91,15,Washington,Yakima Valley,Gewürztraminer
"This is 100% Riesling from the up-and-coming Ancient Lakes AVA. Residual sugar is around 10 g/L, but it's fruit-driven and just slightly off dry, with the fresh acidity and minerality which typify this vineyard's Rieslings. Vibrant with flavors of pineapple, orange flesh and peel, this food friendly wine could be cellared until 2019.",91,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"This young wine is classic and spicy, with still-yeasty aromas of pear and apple. The flavors are focused, with vivid, lightly lemony acidity underscoring highlights of beeswax and flowers.",91,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"Mourvèdre provides a leathery backbone to an otherwise very fruit-driven wine from pioneering Paso Robles producer Adelaida. Graphite and pomegranate lead the aromas. On the palate, the medium-, almost light-bodied wine features purple flowers, raspberry, and more pomegranate, with a surprisingly strong acidity that delivers refreshing verve. This versatile wine could pair with everything from Chinese food and tacos to marinated skirt steak and chicken soup.",91,25,California,Paso Robles,Mourvèdre
"Burgundy in color, this soft, lush wine opens with seductive red berry fruit before delving into a velvety texture and forest floor earthiness. There's a luxurious quality to this wine, shockingly fair priced, amid enviable structure and balance. On the finish, there's a fine leathery coating on the tongue.",91,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Scents of peach and melon are layered with deep mineral tones on this gorgeously aromatic Riesling. The palate is lavish, with stone fruit and blossom flavors, yet it's steely and dry, with a waxy richness that lends volume and power to the finish. This is elegance epitomized.",91,19,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"From the folks behind Roederer Estate, its premier producer of sparkling wine, is this gorgeous still Chardonnay, clean, complex and crisp with a heady perfume of luscious pear and honey. Decadent and yet restrained, the mouthfeel is mellow, a touch decadent, with just the suggestion of its time in barrel.",92,28,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay
"This estate-grown, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc is succulent, tart and tangy, with lightly spicy citrus, kiwi and starfruit flavors. The lingering finish, lightly flecked with dried herbs, shows amazing grip and texture, with a mineral ridge across the mid palate. Great elegance and length.",92,17,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"This is a pretty, floral and balanced wine, elegantly austere in preserved lemon, yuzu and grapefruit, with richer overtones that build on the medium-body toward the lengthy finish. A wine made for the table, it'll pair well and widely, though it can also stand deliciously on its own.",93,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"A fairly priced varietal wine, this shows currant, cranberry, raisin and a flurry of allspice on the nose. It takes on rose petal and lavender aromas as it opens, making it all the more pleasant and memorable.",90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"There is a lot going on in this unique, affordably priced blend of 36% Pinot Noir, 28% Syrah, 27% Merlot and 9% Zinfandel—underripe mulberry, thyme, crushed pepper and fennel aromas on the nose. It balances well on the palate, where bright acidity and textural tension hold the boysenberry, anise and lavender flavors together.",90,28,California,Monterey,Red Blend
"Extremely pungent yet not overdone aromas of ruby red grapefruit, tropical flowers and passion-fruit juice show on this great interpretation of the often sweet-leaning grape. Despite the showy nose, it's quite tight and dry on the palate, with flavors of pear and apple skins, lime rinds and yellow grapefruit.",92,26,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Malvasia Bianca
"Demure in stature yet brooding with power, this late-release 2012 Riesling is compelling evidence of winemaker Steve Shaw's soft-spoken dynamism. Semidry in style, it's light as a feather, yet richly layered with shades of grapefruit, spice and smoke. While delicious now, it's rigidly structured still, and likely to continue to improve for many years to come.",92,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This blend of 53% Mourvèdre, 42% Grenache and 5% Cinsault mixes up fresh raspberry fruit aromas with mint, light licorice, charred meats, white pepper, lavender and bouquet garni. The palate centers on strawberry and raspberry, balanced by plum-peel tannins and seasoned with sage, anise and chaparral herbs. It's a very versatile Rhône blend.",92,20,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend
"Deep color, firm tannins and a fine-grained texture set this wine apart. It smells fresh and sophisticated, with bright cranberry and rich black-cherry notes shaded by cinnamon and nutmeg. This should stand up to the richest rack of lamb and age well, too. It's tempting to drink now, but should improve through at least 2018.",92,24,California,Red Hills Lake County,Malbec
"Bone dry and concentrated, it was fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral oak. Lush floral and citrus aromatics carry over into the flavors, with a streak of Curaçao liqueur as well.",90,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Fresh, vivid fruit flavors pop from this light-colored, well-balanced, mouthwatering wine. Ripe pear, crisp apple and a touch of baking spices mingle on the palate and linger on the finish.",90,16,California,Potter Valley,Chardonnay
"An impressive young Cabernet from a region not well known for Cabs. The first impression is a complex aroma of herb, dark cherry and dark chocolate that continues through to the palate. The texture is laced well with fine, firm tannins that will make it great with rich meat and cheese dishes. Overall it is concentrated and full-bodied, big but balanced.",90,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Winemaker Ryan Deovlet isn't afraid of prominent oak, so this comes on with a luscious butterscotch nose, and it immediately smells like it will be a silky wine. It is, with accents of vanilla and a touch of bitterness, but the overriding flavor is smokiness, reminiscent of the rustic Mexican liquor, Mezcal. This could easily handle pork carnitas.",90,24,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Rhône-style White Blend
"This is old vine (1978), Wente clone Chardonnay, with bright, spicy fruit flavors of banana, pear and melon. A touch of toast and cracker comes from barrel-fermentation in neutral French oak. Forward and rich, this is one to drink up while it's young and fresh.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
"The family-owned, Santa Lucia Highlands-focused Wrath Winery produces their Ex Anima line to show off wines from their estate San Saba Vineyard made with very little intervention and no new oak. This wine is nearly as clear as water, and yet offers aromas or freshly cut grass, honeydew melon, kiwi and fresh rain on rocks. On the palate, minerality lingers alongside poached pear and peach. Refreshing and light, yet full of flavor.",90,19,California,Monterey,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is actually Wahluke Slope fruit, though labeled simply Columbia Valley. Tart pomegranate fruit, a seam of clay and well-integrated highlights of herb and earth mark this extremely limited-production wine as special. Dolcetto does not have much of a track record in Washington, but what's here is quite promising.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Dolcetto
"Though it's 100% varietal, this sports a strong floral streak, as if dominated by Gewürztraminer. Baby-powder scents and accents shift into a fruit core of citrus, with Meyer lemon, oranges and pineapple.",90,16,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"Meaty and dense, this full-bodied red is expansive on the palate in well-defined layers of leather, blueberry and black pepper flavor.",90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Syrah
"A fairly priced varietal wine, this shows currant, cranberry, raisin and a flurry of allspice on the nose. It takes on rose petal and lavender aromas as it opens, making it all the more pleasant and memorable.",90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Ribbon Ridge is making a name for itself as a premier AVA for Oregon Riesling. This rich, mineral-laden wine is scented with orange blossoms and loaded with fruit flavors of Bosc pears, peaches, apricots and a touch of grapefruit. It's big, full bodied, fresh and powerful, and an excellent value.",93,20,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Riesling
"Onesta is Jillian Johnson's debut of her own wines; she previously made Cinsault-based reds and rosés for the Phoenix Ranch brand. She is not new, however, to the indelible Bechthold Vineyard and its ancient Cinsault grapes, and her passion and expertise with the site shows gorgeously here. Orange-pink in hue, this beauty shares notes of crushed strawberry that are perfectly in balance with its dry, elegant point-of-view. Sip this one all night long, with food or without.",92,18,California,Lodi,Rosé
"Brander's Sauvignon Blancs are so rich in their own right, they don't even need oak. But when you take a good one, as this is, and add some new French barrels, it becomes even richer. Blended with 35% Semillon, this wine has serious weight and texture, with complex layers of citrus and tropical fruits, buttercream, vanilla and toast. It's a very nuanced white wine, so do not drink it too cold.",92,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Rich, medium dry, and loaded with lemon, orange and citrus scents and flavors, this is a marvelous wine graced with a lush, textural, mineral-drenched mouthfeel. Despite the low alcohol there is just the gentlest touch of sweetness from 8 g/L residual sugar.",92,28,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Riesling
"Made from a single-vineyard source of Pinot Noir grapes, this lovely pinkish-red wine is a celebration of wild strawberry. Dry, crisp and refreshing, it offers a twist of citrus on the finish and a floral backbone of honeysuckle.",92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"This tasty, toasty red wine is all Sangiovese. The tangy red berry fruit flavors carry highlights of peppery herbs. With some air time the wine smoothes out and rolls into a creamy, mocha-infused finish.",90,29,Washington,Red Mountain,Sangiovese
"The first-ever varietal Malbec for Barrister, this captures the vivid core of tart, delicious, juicy and deep raspberry fruit, elevated further with lemony acidity. The wine is penetrating, tart and quite young, but lip-smackingly tasty.",90,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Malbec
"A savory nose of roasted red pepper and marinated black olives makes this wine from the Santa Ynez Valley's first estate winery stand out from the crowd. There are green elements that some may consider unwanted, but the round, peppery spiciness makes for an intriguing, distinctive palate. This would go well with a New York strip and could stand up to prime rib with horseradish.",90,20,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Merlot
"A sophisticated Chardonnay from a winery known for good values. Buttery in aroma, it has a rich texture without being full-bodied, and is appetizingly dry and subtle in fruit flavor. Notes of toasted almond and baking spices come out on the palate and linger on the finish.",90,16,California,Lake County,Chardonnay
"Full-flavored and textured, probably from the use of a Sauvignon Musque Clone for half of the wine, this is nonetheless a light wine, subtle in stone fruit, kiwi and lemon-lime. The acidity has an electricity and bubbliness that almost make it come alive. It's the right wine for fresh-shucked oysters.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Sourced from the Blackrock Vineyard, production has quadrupled with no loss of quality. Pale copper, wonderfully aromatic, and showing the muscle and verve of the grape, this artfully melds scents and flavors of rose petals and peaches, with a touch of well-ripened tannin.",90,18,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Franc
"This seduces with flavors of juicy, ripe berries, spicy plums and black cherries. It delivers the complexity, density and mocha finish of a much more expensive Merlot.",90,10,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Rich and floral, this top-notch Pinot Blanc hits the palate with verve and ripe, complex fruit flavors. There's a streak of delicious vanilla under the honeydew and Meyer lemon richness, and the length and power are especially impressive for a Pinot Blanc.",92,21,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"This is likely the last vintage from this vineyard, which the family winery seemingly mastered in this bottling. There's an underlying umami-driven smoked meat backbone to the nose that also shows bold cherry blossom, olallieberry, pepper, dried herbs and blackberry-soy sauce. The palate is complex yet doesn't overpower, with bits of purple flowers, blueberry, black pepper and menthol.",94,28,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah
"A complex and complete wine with everything in place, this tastes delicious from the first whiff to the lingering finish. It has fresh-baked bread and light peach aromas and white-cherry flavors. Well balanced, it's layered on a subtle level and harmonious.",93,29,California,Anderson Valley,Sparkling Blend
"Sourced entirely from the Chelle den Millie vineyard, the grapes were picked and processed specifically for rosé. A deep, delicious and rather potent summer wine, it captures the brisk cherry fruit without entangling it in too much tannin or herb. It's all about the fruit, and bravo for that.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"At first, all you sense is a heavy, operatic costume of chocolaty, smoky, coffee-like oak flavors. Underneath these, a ripe and slightly sweet boysenberry soul keeps the drama going. Like a sturdy stage set, the richly laced tannins support the fruit and oak until the curtain falls.",90,25,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
"Part of an interesting lineup of 100% Syrahs, this offers classy, varietal berry fruit with medium concentration. Suggestions of pepper, coffee and anise filter through the finish.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Exuberant in red fruit, this is a softly textured Zinfandel, high in acidity with evolved tannins. Layered, complex and food-friendly, the imprint of red berry and brambly blackberry juiciness is joined by swirls of nuanced vanilla and a touch of oak. There's a sprinkling of black pepper on the palate, too.",90,29,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"Cabernet Sauvignon is 75% of the blend, with the other four Bordeaux varieties making up the rest. Scents of Bourbon barrel greet you upon opening. Then black cherry and cassis fruit emerges, with a layer of dark chocolate ripping through the ripe tannins. This is a super effort at this price, from a fine vintage, with excellent concentration.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Chalk Line includes all five Bordeaux grapes along with 25% Syrah. The first sniff brings up generous red and purple fruit aromas and pretty, yet restrained, barrel toast. It's well-integrated with medium density and excellent balance.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"The wines from this collaboration between Charles Smith and Charles Bieler continue to impress. The rosé is mostly Syrah, with small amounts of Cinsault, Grenache, Counoise and Mourvèdre. It's a complex, fashionably stylish take on rosé. Light fruit flavors of berry and melon are detailed and refreshing, with exceptional length on the palate.",90,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Rosé
"A bright, fresh nose of rose petals, brisk raspberry juice, cranberry, turned earth and a pinch of white pepper makes for a lively wine. The palate begins with juicy strawberry then settles into anise and citrusy spice, an expertly lively wine with chalky texture and vibrant energy. Winemaker Lane Tanner is new at Grenache, but she's rocking it.",93,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache
"A rosé of Grenache, grown in Fair Play, Neophyte is golden peach in color and crisp, with a long, spicy finish. Swirls of cucumber, watermelon and Nilla Wafer add depth to the palate. Only 60 cases made.",91,18,California,Fair Play,Rosé
"Rich in silky bright blackberry fruit, this blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Tempranillo and 8% Syrah-all varieties that have found a happy home in Lake County-is simply delicious. The leathery earthiness of the Tempranillo shines through most brightly, tempered by the structured tannins of the Cab and given a hit of pepper from the Syrah. Enjoy with roast chicken or smoked salmon.",91,18,California,Lake County,Red Blend
"Chestnut Hill is the winery's highest-elevation vineyard, and in a fine vintage such as this, it merits reserve-level treatment. It would be wonderful if more Oregon wineries made Pinot Gris of this caliber, and could sell it at an approachable price, but it's a tough category. Latch onto this rich and concentrated gem if you can; it's a gorgeous mix of apple, pear, chalk and lightly toasted almonds.",92,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Here is an outstanding stainless-fermented Chardonnay, thick and fruity. It's totally loaded with ripe apple and pear-pastry goodness, and the flavors dive deep into a thoroughly delicious, textural finish.",92,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"A full-bodied but not over-the-top Zin that is deliciously fruity, tasting like raspberry jam and fresh blueberries. No overt oak flavors mask the pure enjoyment of well-ripened and carefully fermented grapes. It's extremely smooth, ever so slightly sweet and has a rich, lingering finish.",90,26,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"Sourced from vines planted 45 years ago, this ripe and floral wine offers classically varietal scents of flowers, while flavors recall pear and peach. The length and detail are excellent.",90,15,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chenin Blanc
"Turbine Red has 45% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 28% Mourvèdre. A burst of bright strawberry fruit focuses around a smooth mouthfeel of more black and red fruit and still-grippy tannins. The finish enters into more classic Syrah and Mourvèdre territory, with leathery, earthy layers nicely intermingling.",90,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend
"Brightly pink in color, this dry rosé is more flavorful and assertive than it looks. It layers red fruit aromas such as cherry and raspberry on top of equally bright fruit flavors, all carried into the finish with lip-smacking acidity.",90,18,California,Potter Valley,Pinot Noir
"From a dark bottle, this salmon-colored rosé is medium-bodied and made in a bigger style than many others. Fully textured, it discloses flavorful touches of crunchy pear and cranberry. It would go well with a goat cheese salad adorned in dried cranberries and cherries.",90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Barrel fermented in neutral French oak, this mouth-watering Pinot Blanc uses fruit from the Meredith Mitchell and Freedom Hill vineyards. It rested on the lees until bottling, yielding a rich, even creamy wine, with a gentle spiciness and plenty of acidity. A hint of beeswax and the lightest suggestion of toast bring more interest to the finish.",91,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"Thistle consistently produces one of Oregon's best Pinot Blancs. This is creamy and fresh, bursting with ripe pear and melon, and streaked with a gentle hint of coconut and vanilla. The lush finish seems to carry on for a full minute or longer.",91,18,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Blanc
"This is a lovely Syrah. It has a medium-bodied lightness that feels velvety in the mouth, and is packed with sweet blackberry, plum, mocha and bacon flavors, accented with smoky sandalwood. Nice to drink now, and will gain traction over the next 6–8 years.",91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"An Eastside Lodi Zin classic with its retention of high acidity and tight tannins, this is a complex wine with spicy leather, black tea and bright raspberry flavors. Elegant, soft and extremely drinkable, it has a smooth mid-palate that lingers to the finish—a parting gift of cherry and vanilla that'll keep you coming back for more.",91,28,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
"This is quintessential Napa Petite Sirah. It's the color of a moonless midnight, showing only some purple at the glass's rim. The tannins are huge and mouth-numbing, while the flavors are extravagantly rich with black cherries and dark chocolate. This is a wine you surely want to cellar. Drink from 2016 and beyond.",91,28,California,St. Helena,Petite Sirah
"Buttery-crusted cranberry pie aromas meet with smoked meats, pencil lead and beef jerky on the nose of this private-label wine by longtime producer Stephen Felten, who has more than 40 years of winemaking experience. The palate shows brown flavors, from dried oregano and marjoram to coffee beans and mocha, with a bit of smoked red-cherry fruit.",93,21,California,San Luis Obispo County,Pinot Noir
"Crisp, dry and searing in acidity, this 100% varietal wine is complex, showing sour lemon and brine notes, with orange blossom tones weaving their way throughout. A delight on the palate, the wine takes on structured weight toward the finish, making sure to leave an impression.",91,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"A remarkable shade of slightly purple bubblegum, Kathy Joseph's wine shows strawberries and buttery croissants on the nose. The flavors are boisterous and nearly effervescent, with berries, yeast and a long-lasting sense of strawberry mousse. This one goes down all too easy.",91,22,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir
"Quite ripe raspberry juice, cola, roses and violet candy shows on the nose of this wine from the veteran producer along Highway 101 in southern San Luis Obispo County. The palate offers root beer, cola, cream soda, chocolate-covered cherries and cappuccino elements.",91,25,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Pinot Noir
"A jump forward in quality for this pure Tempranillo. It opens with a dark, smoky nose—oaky but compelling. The midpalate remains tight and hard, but shows muscular black fruits, good length, and leads nicely into a balanced finish with ripe tannins.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Tempranillo
"Merlot is certainly one of the real strengths at Fidélitas, and two different versions are offered. This broad and flavorful effort has pretty cherry fruit backed with pleasing baking spices. The finish is focused and precise, adding streaks of cinnamon and chocolate.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Unbelievable that there's no oak on this Chardonnay. It's so rich and creamy in vanilla, tangerine, peach and apricot flavors, you won't miss that hit of buttered toast. The acidity is marvelous.",91,16,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
"This is brimming with the tropical fruit, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors typical of Viognier. Dry and elegant, it is ripe, but shows the acidity from the cool 2010 vintage.",91,20,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Viognier
"Smooth and chocolaty, this palate-coating Syrah brings ripe black-cherry flavors into a lush and compelling core. Just a hint of leather does not detract from the powerful fruit.",91,24,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"A beautiful rosé bubbly, from the copper-salmon color to the final finish. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and refined, with complex orange, raspberry, vanilla cream, mineral and brioche flavors. Gains extra points for the smoothness of its bubbles.",90,27,California,Anderson Valley,Champagne Blend
"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% Sémillon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity. If it were not fermented dry, this would be a stunning late harvest dessert wine.",90,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"You'll barely notice a touch of oak on this dry wine. It shows the zesty acidity and varietal purity of all Edna Valley whites, with citrus, lychee, tart green apple and white pepper flavors that stimulate the palate and prepare it for food. A very nice job in a restaurant-style Sauvignon Blanc.",90,18,California,Edna Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Labeled dry and tasting very much so, this clean, floral-scented Gewürztraminer has a pleasingly dusty aspect; rose petals with a thin veneer of incense. Long and complex.",90,14,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Here's a very rich, elaborate wine that defines the modern, ripe style of Zinfandel. You certainly can't complain about the fruit, which is massive in red and black berry and stone fruit flavors, sprinkled with black pepper, cinnamon and star anise. It's a little hot and sweet in alcohol, but then again, this is an Alexander Valley Zin.",90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"Virtually identical with Pinot Noir, and quite a good one at that. Shows cool-climate influence in the translucent color, vital acidity and pure flavors of raspberries and persimmons, accented with smoky oak.",90,24,California,Sonoma Mountain,Pinot Meunier
"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"This is at the sweetest edge of off dry (alcohol at 9%, residual sugar 5.1%) and it is loaded with citrus fruit—especially ripe orange—that keeps it lively and refreshing. A well-made, full-bodied Riesling that lingers gracefully through the finish, with a streak of lemon tea.",90,12,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"Somewhat light in color, this wine offers pleasing notes of flowers, milk chocolate, vanilla extract, herbs and carob. It's light and silky in feel with abundant milk chocolate and cherry flavors that linger.",91,27,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Franc
"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish.",91,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"As fresh as a young white wine can be, this sappy Riesling opens with lovely floral aromas, that lend the palate a bit of Gewürztraminer-like soapiness. It turns spicy and penetrating, with Meyer lemon and other expressions of tart citrus.",90,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot, this bright and grapy effort pleasingly integrates slightly rougher notes of earth, leaf and stem. It all works here, adding texture and detail to the tart berry fruits. Drink in the next 3–5 years.",90,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ottomino consistently has success with this single-vineyard Zinfandel. As always, it's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, chocolate and spice.",90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"A clean, spicy Chardonnay, with classic flavors of oranges, green apples, pears and spices. The oak influence is minimal, allowing the fruit and acidity to star. This shows an elegance that places it at the forefront of Chardonnays in this price range.",90,13,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"This shows the meatier side of Mourvèdre, with flavors of soft leather, purple berries, fragrant wildflowers and earth. The finish is long and savory.",90,26,California,El Dorado,Mourvèdre
"Estate grown, this 100% Syrah has excellent concentration and round, mouthfilling fruit flavors. Cherries and plums are highlighted with baking spices and a finishing wash of rich mocha. Very tasty, forward, and drinking at its best right now.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"This appealing wine is already five years old but could use more time to show its best. The aromas of black pepper, licorice and blackberry are generous. Taut and tart fruit flavors come with a pleasing mouthfeel and a finish that lingers. Best from 2018 to 2021.",91,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"Rich, ripe black berries, briar and bramble waft from this intensely aromatic wine. It's rather sexy, opulent and yielding with black cherry and plum flavors accented by tinges of clay, fur and leather.",91,27,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
"Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine brings aromas and flavors of cherry, coffee, herbs, medicine cabinet and oak spices. The style is reserved, with a seamless, focused feel to the tart cherry and plum flavors that keep the attention on each sip.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here is a full-throttle style of Malbec, smoky and dark, with flavors of deep, dense black fruits wrapped in a coat of espresso and chocolate. A spicy, lingering finish holds your attention with muscular, substantial tannins.",90,26,Washington,Yakima Valley,Malbec
"An excellent Washington Malbec, this spicy delight sets up beautifully on the palate with bright, crisply defined, varietal fruit flavors of boysenberry, black cherry and cassis. Precise and penetrating, with excellent balance, it keeps the barrel flavors light and minimal.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec
"This is a flamboyant wine made in the oaky style. It's opulent in pineapple, golden mango and pear flavors, with a coating of sweet oak. The richness is brightened by tart acidity. Drink this flashy wine now, with the richest fare you can.",90,28,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"Raspberry syrup and rose hips mark the entry of this wine, an relatively affordable offering from the appellation. Softly layered in red and black cherry as well as more brambly blackberry, it takes on additional complexity in its specks of baking spice, mostly cardamom, before a finish robust in tannin says adieu.",90,24,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"An opulence of mouthfeel is highly plump and pleasing in this deeply textural Pinot Gris. It's dry in style, but lush and fruity, drenching the palate in grapefruit and white peach flavors. Nuanced by hints of chalk and oyster shell, it's a complex, satisfying wine brightened with zesty lime acidity.",90,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Pinot Gris
"Touches of menthol and lime zest lend a cool, green feel to this off-dry Riesling. White grapefruit and honeydew rind flavors are crisp yet concentrated on the palate, bolstered by a kick of acidity that lingers on the finish.",90,13,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This young wine brims with fresh acidity and primary cherry, blackberry and cola flavors. The complexity is considerable and so is the elegance. It feels graceful and silky in the mouth, despite the power of the fruit. Should hit its peak in two or three years.",90,25,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir
"Tight and focused, this has a fine core of black cherry and cassis. Layers of coffee and dark chocolate are wrapped around the fruit, and the wine is compact and textural. Excellent now, but probably better in a few years.",90,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a proper El Dorado Zin. It's still tight and tannic, but air and time reveal a lovely bouquet of lavender and crushed herbs that's layered, soft and spicy on the finish. Miraflores is making some lovely wines and this is one worth seeking out.",90,25,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
"Tasting similar to Chardonnay, this has a buttery, creamy texture that frames orange, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It gains extra points for delicacy and balance. The appellation is in San Benito County, about 25 miles inland from Monterey.",90,20,California,Paicines,Pinot Blanc
"What's so interesting about this wine is the savory minerality, racy acidity and extreme dryness that make it completely different from 99% of the Sauvignon Blancs in California. It's not without fruit. You'll find mouthwatering Meyer lemons, sweet Kaffir limes and spicy figs. Just beautiful, and a real sommelier's wine.",91,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Sometimes a reserve designation on a Chardonnay simply translates to excessive use of new oak; here it brings a rich abundance of fruit, along with a density and texture rarely found in domestic Chardonnays. This is a fruit salad of a wine, to be sure, running through a farmer's market's worth of peaches, apples, pears, apricots, bananas and more. But it also brings the butter, the butterscotch and the barrel toast, layered in and wrapped around the fruits so it has the richness of a banana split, and some of the creaminess as well.",91,26,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"This is a classy Chardonnay. Grown 1,200 feet above Calistoga and fairly well-oaked in new barrels, it's rich and complex, with flavors of grilled tropical fruits and toasted meringue. The structure is greatly improved by a crisp, minerally edge of acidity.",91,27,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role. It's really an elegant wine and a great value at this price.",91,25,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A really nice, versatile white wine to have with everything from salad Nicoise to roast chicken and pork enchiladas. Crisply acidic and bone dry, it shows tasty lemon and lime flavors, lots of pepper and a hint of gooseberry.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This pure Cabernet is stubbornly unyielding at first, showing a lean and herbal expression. But with extensive (overnight) breathing time, the fresh and bright flavors of boysenberries and cassis pop into focus, the tannins are ripe and polished, the finish still tightly wound but textural and long.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bone-dry Chardonnay for drinking now. This shows great structure, with a keen cut of acidity that brightens the mineral-driven orange and pineapple flavors.",90,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"This is a five-grape blend, with leafy flavors of garden-fresh herbs as well as ripe strawberries and vanilla cream. It's a smooth and immediately pleasing wine, with a velvety finish.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Thank goodness this rosé is bone dry for a change, when so many California blushes are sugary sweet. It also shows a bite of acidity and tannins. The flavors range from mineral and rose petal to cherry and herb tea.",90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Rosé
"A proper, textbook Pinot Noir—it's dry, nicely crisp, with smoothly astringent tannins. It has pleasant, complex cherry, pomegranate, plum, tobacco, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Not an ager, so drink up with upscale fare.",90,27,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"Well made and muscular, this compact effort brings black fruit, black olive, black licorice and espresso flavors together in a balanced and strikingly complex Syrah. The blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Lemberger, Sangiovese and Merlot—unusual, but it works.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish. This is very young, compact, and still tight as a drum; it could be cellared for up to a decade.",94,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"This gorgeous new release, from a young winery with a Riesling focus, is resplendent with an enticing mix of flowers, fruits and stone. The scents well up from the glass and the flavors fill the mouth with a lively zest, pulling together streaks of lemon, lime, nectarine and apricot, accented with citrus rind and wet rock, honey and lemon tea.",93,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"The 2005 has been co-released with the 2006. The '05 is a better wine, probably due in part to the extra year of age, which has allowed the parts to come together harmoniously. It continues a multiyear streak of being one of the top Chenin Blancs in California. The main feature is dry acidity. It frames apple, citrus, peach and flower flavors, with a nutty, slightly bitter finish. Try as an interesting alternative to Sauv Blanc.",92,20,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chenin Blanc
"A deliciously vibrant wine, with oak-inspired citrus peel, peach, fig and creamy honey-vanilla flavors. However, as succulent as it is, from such a great winery, it could be far better.",91,25,California,Oakville,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This bubbly charms with cherry and raspberry flavors and a touch of limes and vanilla. It's nice and smooth in the mouth, with a creamy mousse. Showing real finesse and elegance, this sparkler will be delicious with raw tuna.",91,20,California,Sonoma County,Sparkling Blend
"Just delicious, a blend of Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache that shows how well Paso Robles can make these Rhône reds. The wine is soft and voluptuous, with complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, milk chocolate, licorice and cinnamon spice. Finishes long and rewardingly dry.",91,18,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.",91,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"So forward and appealing right now, it's hard to resist, but this could gain a little traction with a two or three years of age. It's polished in cherry jam and blackberry-pie filling, with earthy tones of coffee, figs, sage and cedar. The intricate tannins play nicely against the acidity, which gives it an upscale feeling.",91,24,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"From the pretty pale, amber color to the long, distinguished finish, this is a great rosé sparkler. To begin with, it's dry, a point in its favor, while the flavors are subtle and complex. They suggest pink grapefruits, tangerine zest, a squeeze of white peach, vanilla, and the smoke and dough of oak and lees. With its low alcohol and very low pH, it's a balanced wine of great structural integrity.",91,26,California,Anderson Valley,Sparkling Blend
"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.",91,25,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"The blend is 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot. Another fine effort from this young winery. Here is classic styling from a great vineyard source, with beautiful definition, and gorgeous, refined and sculpted fruit framed in concise, molded, firm tannins. The tart red fruit is wrapped in crisp acids and finished with tight, hard, slightly bitter tannins. The penetration and elegance of this wine are what stand out; it's young and compact and suggests a long life ahead.",91,27,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A smashing success, this exceptional value is loaded with the typical fruit flavors of cut green apple, pineapple and melon. The fruit is set in a creamy frame and finished with beautifully restrained oak accents that support it without burying it.",91,20,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Chardonnay
"Ballentine's Chenins nearly always impress, and this is one of their best. Bone dry and very crisp, almost tart, in acids, the wine shows intriguing lime, wildflower and sweet French green bean flavors.",91,15,California,Napa Valley,Chenin Blanc
"The aromas of black pepper and grilled meat immediately pinpoints this as a cool-climate Syrah, and quite a good one. It's dry, rich and smoothly tannic, with blackberry, blueberry, bacon and smoky cedar flavors. While it's asy to drink now, this should hold over the next six years.",90,28,California,Sonoma County,Syrah
"Run, don't walk, to find this amazingly priced Cabernet. It's so good and rich, it easily holds its own against Cabs costing five times as much. Dry and smooth in tannins, it offers a burst of blackberry, black cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors, with a wonderful coating of oak. Drink now–2013.",93,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wonderfully rich wine combines the best of all three varieties to produce a complex white. It shows rich green apple, pineapple jam, superripe apricot, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and while it's tremendously honeyed on the finish, it is basically dry. Crisp acidity, probably from the Carneros Chardonnay, provides needed balance.",91,28,California,Napa Valley,White Blend
"Packs plenty of powerful complexity into a dry wine that's a pretty good price. Made in full-Burgundian style, with barrel fermentation and lees aging, it's a rich, creamy wine packed with spicy tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Try as an interesting alternative to an upscale Chardonnay.",91,20,California,Carneros,Roussanne
"The estate bottling is 100% Sémillon and tastes a bit riper and more peachy than the Columbia Valley bottling, though perhaps less nuanced. Barrel fermented in both new and second year French oak, it adds honeysuckle, sweet apple and a hint of mint to the sweet fruit.",91,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sémillon
"Rewards for its rich Champagne personality and California expression of fruity flavor. Although the texture could be a bit smoother, the wine has a fine mousse, with complex, subtle flavors of strawberries, limes, vanilla, yeasty dough and wood smoke.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"What a great Zinfandel this is. It's lusty and hearty, just the way you want a Zin to wash down barbecue, but it also has balance and even elegance, despite the high alcohol. The ripe blackberry and cherry flavors are jammy, complexed with spicy tobacco and chocolate, and a pure finish of cassis.",90,20,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
"As is usually the case, Bernardus's regular Monterey Chard offers lots of bang for the buck. Dry and crisp in citrusy acids, it has complex flavors of pineapple, grapefruit, kiwi, lime and spicy coconut macaroon, with delicious oak influence.",90,20,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
"Dry, tannic and well-structured, this wine erupts with white pepper aromas and flavors. Then the fruit kicks in, all blackberry jam, leather, espresso, bitter chocolate and toasted cedar wood. It's different from the usual Lodi Zin, taking it to a higher plane of elegance and sophistication.",90,16,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
"This is a thoroughly delicious wine, pure-blooded Syrah from three vineyards. It puts bright, clean raspberry fruit right up front, then layers in a hint of bramble and earth against a foundation of firm, fine-grained tannins. It's authoritative, substantial, straightforward and absolutely tongue-riveting, a brilliant combination of finesse, tension and balance.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"These grapes come from a variety of vineyards scattered widely across the state, but they add up to a 98% pure Cabernet Sauvignon, intense, dark, plummy, rich and full-bodied. It's got all the grape's key component flavors on display: olive, light herb, and juicy purple fruits. The oak is still coming into focus, with strong notes of vanilla and clove. Give it a few hours breathing time.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pours inky black, and smells young and backward. Lots of airing reveals blackberry jam, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and toast. Drinks soft, velvety, luscious and complex. Good berry fruit is supported by firm, dry tannins. Lovely now, and best consumed in the next year or so to capture its vibrant youth.",92,28,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Laurel Glen's second wine, and no slouch. This vintage brings a richly textured, deeply flavored Cab as good as many costing far more. Ripe flavors of currants are wrapped in toasty oak, with firm but plush tannins. Will age through the decade and improve. A good value.",91,25,California,Sonoma Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bright and spicy, this is Pinot Gris with a bit of the grassy bite of a Loire Valley Sauvignon Blanc. Racy and loaded with grapefruit and pineapple flavors, this lingers lazily through a refreshing, acid-driven finish that invites further sipping.",92,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"This fancy, opulent Chardonnay is made in a certain Santa Rita style of high alcohol, which makes it enormously rich. It oozes pineapple, pear and lime jam fruit, while new oak adds buttered toast flavors and the glycerine from 15.5% alcohol makes the wine even creamier and sweeter. This is an inaugural vintage from the winery.",92,29,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"A fine bottle, fresh and fruity, with cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit in abundance. It's got depth and vitality, a youthful verve that promises fine ageability. Aged in 28% new French oak, it is just barely kissed with toast and mocha. A wonderful value.",92,26,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"This lovely brut offers real Champagne-like finesse. It's rich and dry, with yeasty flavors of pineapples, lemon chiffon and raspberries. The mousse is creamy and smooth. This polished bubbly will develop with five years of cellaring.",90,19,California,Anderson Valley,Sparkling Blend
"Here is yet another Washington Riesling that shows how good these wines can be. This is well beyond the sweet and fruity style of the tasting room wines; here are layers of stone fruits, density and weight, length and detail. Once in the mouth this explodes with flavor and keeps bringing the oranges, peaches, apricots, nectarines and apples to the table.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Shows the softness of Alexander Valley Chardonnay, and the delicious complexity that these wines can attain. Apricots, pineapples, peaches and Meyer lemons are the fruits, framed by vanilla and smoke from new oak, and finishing with a minerality that must come from the earth.",90,26,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
"Mostly Pinot Noir with some Chardonnay, this bubbly shows the pedigree of these two noble varieties in its balance and elegance. It has rich Champagne-like flavors of smoke, brioche, raspberry, lime and vanilla, and finishes dry and polished. This is a great price for a sparkling wine of this quality and sophistication.",90,19,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"This wine is formulaic in a good way; L'Ecole “owns” Sémillon in Washington, and it is hard to think of any winery in the country that does a better job with the grape. Aged sur lie in neutral oak, blended with 14% Sauvignon Blanc and put through malolactic for added creaminess, this is a delicious, rich and succulent wine that deftly mixes flavors of nettle, lime and melon with vanilla custard and a hint of butterscotch.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"Here's Washington Syrah in the flesh, unadulterated, unblended, blasting out aromas of wild berries, spicy cranberry and rhubarb. It leads into a tart and peppery wine with whiffs of smoke and herb; young, wild and just slightly raw. A flavor parade for your mouth.",90,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"This is young, tangy, juicy and sweet, with ripe but quite tart fruit, showing plenty of acid and citrus rind. The toasty oak flavors are front and center, and delicious. All the Gamache red wines will benefit from additional bottle age, which will soften and meld the bacon fat, herb and sharp spice flavors. There is a lot of potential here for further development.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this is the most elegant and delicate of the winery's current bubblies. It's a dry, sophisticated wine, with subtle citrus, peach, apple and yeast flavors. If you've never cellared a sparkling wine, try stashing this away for up to a decade.",90,24,California,Carneros,Sparkling Blend
"This debut blend somehow reaches 15% alcohol, not easy to do with Yakima Valley Sangiovese. It's a solid effort, which opens well—supple and polished, with pretty flavors of mixed plum and berry. It's silky, smooth and there's plenty of tangy fruit. The finish gets a little too hot, but that's a minor quibble in a wine that gives you this much flavor at this price. The finish keeps getting more and more interesting, piling on smoked ham and spicy clove as it goes.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Pale, light-bodied, fruity and dry, this is the un-Cabernet, the red for white wine lovers. So easy to enjoy, you might overlook its complexities. Red cherries, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cinnamon and ginger candy, it's really delicious. Drink now for its freshness.",90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Dry, sauvage and nicely detailed, this bright, tart, citrusy wine has a truly great mouthfeel. Done entirely in stainless steel, it is packed with flavors of fresh fruit skins, lingering with crisp and textural spice. Just 12.6% alcohol puts it squarely into the Sancerre range.",90,9,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Fumé Blanc
"Spicy and packed with mixed citrus peel, tangerine, white peach, stone fruit, mineral and licorice. This really delivers the full complement of varietal flavors, in a well-structured, tartly crisp wine.",90,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"Fruit from moe than 20 vineyards went into this three-county blend. The result is a beautiful wine. Dry and spicy, it has lush pineapple, vanilla custard, tapioca, peaches and cream and gingerbread flavors, and a lush, creamy texture. Notable also for the crisp, brisk mouthfeel.",90,26,California,Sonoma County-Monterey County,Chardonnay
"Fans of Petite Sirah will exult. This darkly brooding wine is heavy, tannic and fully dry, although at the cost of very high alcohol. The flavors, of extraordinarily ripe red and black cherries, currants, espresso, sweet leather and mushu plum sauce, finish with an unsweetened dark chocolate bitterness. It's a wine that will evolve over a decade.",90,25,California,Lake County,Petite Sirah
"Another of the new crop of Cabs, and a very good wine. Meets Napa standards of rich, ripe blackberry and currant fruit and perfectly soft tannins, and is well oaked. Misses by a shade or two the owners' expectations of greatness, but it's at the top of the heap in this price range.",91,26,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Always an interesting Bordeaux blend to taste, this mixture of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Malvasia Bianca and Orange Muscat is alive with citrus, orange blossom, mineral and dried herb aromas and flavors. It's very complex in the mouth, and zesty with fresh acidity. Fun to drink, but also a serious white wine.",90,21,California,Livermore Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A blend of the big three Cabernet valleys, Alexander, Sonoma and Dry Creek. Polished and elegant, with good berry flavors balanced with green olive, dill, unsweetened chocolate and earth. Feels plush in the mouth, smooth and soft, but complex. Good enough for your best fare.",90,16,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is an astonishing value, especially from such a prestigious appellation. Has a silky texture and lush but dry flavors of cherries, raspberries, herbs, mushrooms, coffee and clove that unfold across the palate. Versatile at the table; try with pork tenderloin with plum sauce. With more than 30,000 cases produced, this should be easy to find.",90,8,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"Smells ripe and oaky, with tons of blackcurrant and blackberry fruit. Almost sweet in the mouth with rich oak and ripe fruit, but quite dry, with firm tannins that turn almond-skin bitter on the finish.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Quite good for the vintage, a dense, concentrated wine with beautifully soft, complex tannins. Blackberry and cassis flavors drink dense and dry, with balanced acidity. Possesses that elusive but unmistakable quality of elegance and finesse. This is a big, flamboyant wine, but skillfully vinified; good acidity keeps things bright and crisp.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"I have seldom tasted a Dry Creek Valley Cabernet (the appellation, not the winery) that didn't have a woolly edge to it. This wine is an excellent example. It's briary, with pushy tannins and the succulent flavor of wild blackberries. Oak adds a sheen of vanilla and smoke.",90,21,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is thick and spicy, a raging bull of a wine that skates along the border of Napa Cabernet country. As this Horse Heaven Hills vineyard matures, it is becoming clear that it can deliver the big, broad and deep flavors that put Washington Merlot at the front of the class. What's especially nice about this blend is its intense bouquet of blackberry, spicy anise and cedar. For all of its power this retains its balance, its acidic spine and even a touch of grace.",90,24,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Merlot
"From Duckhorn's second label, this Bordeaux blend is based on Cabernet and Merlot. At less than half the price of Duckhorn's main Cabs and Merlots, it's a very good buy, showing richness, balance and complexity. The blackberry and cherry fruit has been tastefully enhanced with smoky oak. A great food wine.",90,28,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait.",92,28,California,Red Hills Lake County,G-S-M
"Just when this Chard seems simple and sweet, the fruit is overtaken by acidity and minerality, taking the tangerine, lime and mango flavors to the next level and making the wine complex and fascinating. Shows how exceptional winemaking can result in exceptional wine.",92,19,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods.",91,20,California,Lodi,Syrah
"The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit. Consistent in style with the winery's Fumé the Chardonnay has plenty of clean acid, great fruit, and a nice butterscotch finish in the back of the throat.",90,10,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This is a smooth blend of Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills Merlot, with a generous (18%) supplement of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's consistent with previous efforts and reminiscent of Reininger—satiny smooth, glossy and somewhat impenetrable. The tightly wound fruits taste of ripe raspberry, and the bright acidity adds intensity to the toasty, coffee-inflected finish. The wine is dense, supple and extracted, with hints of spice, herb, lemon thyme and citrusy high tones.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Dry, tannic and concentrated, a fierce, almost feral wine, but it's classic in the way of California mountain Zins. Floods the mouth with blackberry essence, wrapped into strong tannins and finishing with a crisp burst of acidity. Compelling and complex, it cries out for a rustic beef or pork dish, long simmered and well-seasoned.",90,28,California,Rockpile,Zinfandel
"The fruit comes from Weinbau, DuBrul and Destiny Ridge. The Weinbau is old vine, and is the main component. This is a solid, meaty, deep purple and blue, with hints of smoked meat in the nose. Fruit flavors are tight, tart and run to the black cherry and blackberry flavors. Clearly varietal, with stiff tannins, a bit chalky, but plenty of varietal character and a long finish with streaks of coffee and light herb. This is winemaker Ron Coleman's favorite red, and he gives it plenty of TLC that shines through in the bottle.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish. The wine also is characterized by crisp, crunchy acidity that makes it racy.",90,18,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Lots to like in this Cab Franc. Shows ripe, attractive cherry compote, black raspberry purée, cola, cocoa, coffee and spice flavors, with a rich, earthy edge of balsamic, sautéed mushroom and oaky vanilla. Then there are the tannins. They kick in and give the wine a youthful, lively structure. Very nice wine, but be sure to decant it for a few hours.",90,19,California,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc
"Concentrated and showing a whiff of volatility, this is a blend of 62% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash each of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Grapes are sourced from three different estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's acidic and extracted, but opens up with exposure to air into a supple, rich, muscular, raspberry and cherry-flavored red blend. There are hints of rock, fennel and smoke, and a long, concentrated and well-rounded finish.",90,22,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A sweet, flavorful Port-style dessert wine. Opens with enticing aromas of cassis, chocolate, caramel, vanilla and smoke. Rich and chocolatly in the mouth, with ripe flavors of currants that are backed up with bracing acidity. Delicious, with a long, sweet finish.",90,24,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A nice, easy-drinking Cabernet that has some real complexity. Opens with cassis, smoke and herb aromas that turn rich and fruity in the mouth. The tannins are pretty firm now and should protect the wine for a few years, should you choose to age it.",90,20,California,Carmel Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich and thoroughly enjoyable, brimming with blackcurrant and cassis flavors and a balanced overlay of smoky, spicy oak. This pretty wine drinks very dry and smooth, and the tannins are just right. It is elegant from start to finish. Drink now.",90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre blend, with a trace of Viognier. It's a big, rich, voluptuous wine, dynamic in berries and vanilla cream from oak, and the acidity must come from that 2% of Viognier. So fruity, it's almost sweet, except that it finishes with a dry flourish. Only 960 cases were produced.",91,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Rhône-style Red Blend
"A home run. Given extra bottle age, this is drinking optimally at the moment, with a spicy, brambly nose mixing blackberries, mint and chocolate-covered cherries. There's a scent of fresh cut wood also, and a mouthful of fruit and barrel flavors that are both nicely integrated and complementary. The long finish lingers into a resonant note of black tea.",91,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"Cabernet from Oakville for under $20? Yes, and it's a really good one. It's dry and full bodied and rich in classic blackberries and cassis. How Kirkland sells it so inexpensively is a mystery. Classically structured, even ageworthy. Drink now–2015.",91,19,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Like it says, this Riesling is bone dry. It's also crisp in acidity, with a tang of minerals and steel. It gains richness from a rich core of lemon, lime and orange citrus flavors, and possesses that note of diesel that a fine, cool climate Riesling shows. Should develop over the next six years.",91,22,California,Oak Knoll District,Riesling
"Balanced and fresh, with a mix of pear, quince, melon and apple, lightly dusted with baking spices, this appealing Pinot Gris is a fine match for salmon, halibut, and other Northwest seafood. Textural, laced with refreshing minerality, and persistent into a long finish, this is Oregon PG at its best.",91,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"A rich, woody style of Pinot Blanc, the barrel toast wrapped around superripe tropical fruit flavors of banana, papaya and pineapple, with a hint of grapefruity acids. This is flat-out delicious, and could easily pass for an expensive Chardonnay.",91,22,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Pinot Blanc
"Citrus and honeydew fruit flavors anchor this unoaked Chardonnay. It has a wonderful leesy texture that enlivens the palate, giving the impression of limestone, or at least lime pulp. Flavors linger, clean and utterly refreshing.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",90,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"This estate-bottled Pinot Gris, from a vineyard planted in 1983, shows some definite residual sugar, despite its alcohol rating of 14.4%. Plenty ripe all right, and plenty tasty, too. This has the body and balance to match up with a fat cut of salmon, perhaps in a semisweet tamari sauce, or a grilled pork roast with a fruit dressing.",90,16,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Pinot Gris
"This gentle, lightly off-dry Riesling was fermented primarily in neutral oak, which seems to have softened the entry without impacting the flavors. Aromatic highlights of honeysuckle and orange marmalade introduce a full palate with a complex fruit mix including raspberry, citrus and orange. The finish brings an impression of cotton candy.",90,19,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Riesling
"This wine immediately wows the palate, bursting into full flavor with an explosion of apple and pear fruit. There's a light yeastiness as well, just enough to suggest a young, fresh, exuberant wine, and it simply grabs hold of your taste buds and never lets go.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Made from Grenache Blanc and Viognier, this pretty and enormously likeable white wine was barrel fermented. It has pleasant flavors of citrus fruits, raspberries, vanilla, white pepper, buttered toast and sandalwood. The finish is clean and zesty.",90,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Rhône-style White Blend
"Made in a lighter style, this Pinot comes from the cooler Napa side of the Carneros. It's light- to medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture and pleasant flavors of cherries, exotic dusty spices and sandalwood. Elegant and moderate in alcohol, it's a wine to drink now.",90,24,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir
"A very pleasant Chardonnay that's lifted above the ordinary by a brisk, dry minerality. Orange, lemon and pear fruit stars, with a suggestion of toast and complicated notes of anise, vanilla and cream.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"This varietally correct Sauvignon Blanc is clean, crisp and refreshing, with plenty of honey, pineapple and green apple, and yet has some meat on its bones, with a rich mouthfeel that belies its all-stainless-steel aging. It also has just a touch (2%) of Sémillon.",90,15,California,Livermore Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A fine, appealing and complex wine, Redhawk's estate bottling shows more concentration than its less expensive stablemates, with nuances of bloody meat and mint that give it an almost Rhônish character. The alcohol is under 14%, and it drinks like a Burgundy, only with beefier tannins.",90,22,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Noir
"This is the kind of Chardonnay that divides wine lovers into enemy camps. Old World purists will criticize the candied richness. New World fans will love the toasted marshmallow, caramel corn and buttered toast flavors that rest on a solid foundation of pineapple and green apple fruit.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crème brûlée. Elegant and impressive for drinking now.",90,27,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"Good value in a solid Napa Valley Cabernet blend with plenty of upscale character. It's dry and firm in tannins, with complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, herbs and cedar. Drink now.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Meritage
"Dark yellow honey in color, this fine blend of 52% Sémillon, 48% Sauvignon Blanc is a nice ode to white Bordeaux, very French in its austerity, with plenty of creaminess and barrel richness, too. Its layers of lemon, peach, honeysuckle and butterscotch unveil themselves slowly, the wine's depth opening over time.",90,22,California,Livermore Valley,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"A fascinating wine. Tastes sweet and finishes bone dry, offering rich, tangerine and honey flavors, accented with crisp acidity. Nice as a cocktail sipper, and will play well with Asian fare.",90,13,California,Anderson Valley,Edelzwicker
"A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare. It's very fruity, offering a burst of raspberries and cherries, together with a coat of sweet, smoky oak. But crisp acidity and smooth, silky tannins provide a balanced structure.",90,17,California,Monterey County,Pinot Noir
"Estate grown, crisp and nicely defined, with a pretty mix of apple, pear, peach and apricot flavors. The fruit is framed with citrus rind (orange and grapefruit) and keeps the wine tight and focused through a clean, lingering finish.",90,24,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Gris
"Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling.",90,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"Believe me, you won't miss the oak barrel influence on this wine. It's so good all by itself. Brightened with crisp Monterey acidity and totally dry, it's rich in pineapple, tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, mineral and vanilla flavors that will satisfy your Chardonnay tooth.",90,16,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
"Young and spicy, with deeply-etched cranberry fruit flavors, limned with leafy herbal tannins. The core of fruit is pretty as can be, and the nicely-managed tannins wrap it in a perfect frame, while giving it added muscle. Another two or three years in the bottle will really bring this into focus.",90,25,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir
"A fine, bone-dry and minerally Sauvignon Blanc to enjoy with shellfish, grilled chicken or on its own as an appetizer. A touch of oak adds richness to the vibrant, acidic citrus fruit, lemongrass and green apple flavors.",90,19,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
"A young and lush Semillon, this shows lush, ripe, rich, round, peachy/citrus fruit. Barrel fermented, it hints at interesting cocoa/nougat flavors also, but the pure, round fruit is what really stands out. Lovely hints of honey streak through the finish.",92,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sémillon
"Otis includes the oldest cabernet vines in Washington state, dating back to the 1950s, and has been a Columbia vineyard-designate since 1981. Black pepper and dried sage are its imprints, and Otis always makes a tight, ageworthy wine, not in the currently fashionable ultraripe mode. Lean and herbal, but deep and ageworthy.",91,23,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Like the winery's syrah, this young wine shows a lot of spicy new oak at the moment, although the specs say only 30% of the barrels were new. There's a full, flavorful mid-palate of cherry and plum, nicely framed against toast, smoke and char. Plenty of power and punch for a pure merlot.",91,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
"Lots of ripe boysenberry, cranberry and sour cherry fruit to start, with a strong foundation of tar, espresso and bitter chocolate. This could pass for a Super Tuscan in a blind tasting. It unfolds slowly, with an interesting herbal/olive edge to it, and will reward additional cellaring.",91,23,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a real success for the winery, made bracingly fresh and crisp despite its 3% residual sugar. Bright flavors of pink grapefruit dominate the palate, filling out a pristine, crisp and deliciously fresh finish.",90,9,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Gewürztraminer
"Extremely likeable and accessible, this cab includes 15% syrah and 5% cab franc. It's loaded with butterscotch and mocha, but the ripe, not over-ripe fruit gives it a clear, clean focus right down the middle.",90,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bigger, with more obvious oak than the CC “regular”, this gets special treatment (hand-stirred for nine months once a week) and 1/4 new oak. It's nicely integrated, big and buttery, with pleasing layers of caramelized sugar and baked apple. A home run.",90,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Columbia pioneered syrah in Washington state, and still leads the pack at this price point. Smooth and varietal, it mixes ripe (not raisiny) fruit in a sleek, muscular wine laced with vanilla, smoked meat and tar.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Butterscotch, vanilla and spicy anise light up this Burgundian-style chardonnay. Its not-too-ripe fruit flavors of melon and citrus keep it crisp and well-defined, and winemaker David Lake has added just the right amount of toasty new oak.",90,19,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
"L'Ecole's other two Semillons are 100%, but this budget bottling smartly blends in just the right amount (13%) of Sauvignon Blanc, filling in the tart kiwi-flavored fruit and light herbs with hints of creamy, spicy oak.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"What a nice wine this is. It's dry and balanced, and although there's a complex structure of tannins, it's drinkable now. The flavors veer between blackberries, plums, coffee, leather and dusty spices.",90,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Merlot
"A lush, dramatic Zin that's fully ripe yet avoids any hint of raisins or excessive sugar. The mouth filling flavors of sweet cherry tart, creme de cassis, vanilla and peppery spices are wrapped in smooth tannins, with a bite of acidity. Super high in alcohol, though.",90,28,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"This new, value brand from winemaker Brian Carter hits the mark with this creamy, smooth, seamless rendition of sauvignon blanc. An oxidative “sur lie” technique keeps it citrus fresh but cuts the herbaceousness.",90,11,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A lovely Chard, filled with crisp acids and steely, stony minerals. The fruit flavors suggest powerfully ripened tropical fruits, and there's a bracing overlay of oak. Notable for its balance and integrity.",90,21,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"A ripe, round and deliciously fruity chardonnay, 50% barrel fermented, with a lip-smacking mix of tropical fruit and sweet crème brulée. Pineapples, peaches, melons and more.",90,11,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
"Like the winery's Old Vine bottling, which comes from the same vineyard, this is a thick, concentrated zinfandel, packed with black cherry and boysenberry fruit, smoke and clove and hints of ham and leather. Young, tannic, fascinating.",90,27,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Zinfandel
"Lovely, lemony jasmine-tea scents and flavors abound in this delicate yet penetrating wine. Clean and fresh, it adds highlights of citrus rind without a trace of bitterness. Pure elegance.",92,26,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Viognier
"This barrel-fermented estate wine is luscious and creamy, coating the palate with generous flavors of apricot, peach and melon. The concentration is impressive, as are the barrel flavors on the finish. Vanilla, coconut, caramel and lightly buttered almonds all contribute to the nuanced detail.",92,25,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Viognier
"This could be the best Pinot Blanc in Oregon right now, with lushness from barrel fermentation offset by the delicate balance throughout. Despite its modest 12.5% alcohol, this is a wine of considerable depth, with a mix of ripe yellow fruits and persistent, toasty highlights.",92,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"This crisp white is inviting and dry, with aromas of citrus, fig and fennel. Reminiscent of a fine Sancerre, it's finely structured, steely and still lushly textured and full enough in the mouth to enjoy with seafood, a creamy goat cheese salad or entirely on its own.",92,18,California,Sierra Foothills,Sauvignon Blanc
"There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing.",92,29,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Noir
"This is a lovely wine, dark golden in color yet fresh on the palate, with piercing flavors of green apple, apricot and flowers, its long finish laced with honey. A wine of noticeable depth and balance that gets better in the glass and would make for an unexpected apéritif.",92,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Grenache Blanc
"A gorgeous effort, awash in high-toned floral aromatics, sharply penetrating, and leading to a densely-packed palate of waxy fruit, honeyed spice, Meyer lemon, citrus and stone fruit. Rich, lush, concentrated and long—what more can you ask from a Viognier?",92,20,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Viognier
"A delightful, dry, citrusy Gewürztraminer, with a mix of dried rind and lightly candied fruit flavors. Lemon-lime and tangerine, a wash of rose water, and a balanced, elegant style, mark this as special.",91,25,Oregon,McMinnville,Gewürztraminer
"So elegant and sophisticated, this is a great value in California Chardonnay. Although it's dry, it's rich and delicious in pineapples, pears, mangoes and honey, with an opulent overlay of sweet oak. The brisk acidity is balanced, and gets the mouth watering.",91,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"A deliciously priced blend of 60% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah and 27% Grenache that'll be tricky to ask for by name but is worth the effort to find and share. This blend shows off brooding dark dollops of spicy fruit, herb and tobacco that are tenaciously balanced by the cherry tones from the Grenache. A fun wine to pass around at parties and barbecues.",91,18,California,Calaveras County,Rhône-style Red Blend
"A tart and beautifully-defined mix of apple and pear fruit, with a steely spine and dappled baking spices. Excellent balance and mouthfeel, with a finishing mineral note.",91,17,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Textbook Napa Cab. It's dry, smoothly tannic and subtle, with blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors nicely intrigued with herbs, tobacco and cedar. Just delicious now and for the next few years.",91,28,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"From a cool, inland section of Mendocino County, this Viognier opens with gorgeous aromatics—heavenly honeysuckle and grapefruit—and offers up crisp, dry, borderline bracing acidity that pulls back just at the right moment. Nicely textured, the finish lingers.",91,24,California,Redwood Valley,Viognier
"A decadent, dark and meaty Syrah, with plenty of sauvage tendencies amid a rich, velvety texture that finishes long and lushly perfumed with sweet smoke. In a cool year in El Dorado, Lava Cap has reined in this Syrah's tannins and let its dark cherry and plum flavors take center stage.",91,21,California,El Dorado,Syrah
"Delicate, but nicely concentrated, with flower and fruit nicely integrated. Meyer lemon, tangerine, pear and even a hint of candied papaya mingle beautifully, set in a fine-tuned frame of acid and mineral.",91,14,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"This 100% old-vine Cinsault preserves the vineyard's earthiness in a unique wine aged in neutral French oak. It's light and bright, tasting of savory rhubarb, with soft layers of spice and a lingering, easy finish.",91,21,California,Lodi,Cinsault
"Great price for a Cabernet this good. It's packed with classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis, plums and cocoa. The tannins are rich and ripe, with an elegantly pure Napa Valley structure. Not an ager, so drink soon.",91,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"You might almost think this is a Pinot Noir, it's so silky, crisply acidic and rich in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and sandalwood. That this is a nearly six-year-old Syrah is a surprise, but a pleasant one. It would not have been possible for this wine to taste this young if it weren't from a cool-climate appellation. Shows the potential of Santa Maria Valley Syrah capable of aging.",91,28,California,Santa Maria Valley,Syrah
"For whatever reason, Keating's 2010 Zin represents a vast improvement over the '09. It's a pretty, polished Zinfandel, the kind called claret-style to distinguish its elegance and balance. Classic Dry Creek Valley, with wild berry, cola, sweet tobacco and spice flavors and briary tannins.",91,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"A distinguished Merlot, dark, dry and brooding. Complex, too, with deep flavors of blueberry, mushroom, dark chocolate and anise. The tannins are fairly fierce despite the softness, but the wine doesn't seem like a longterm ager, so give it a decant before drinking over the next few years.",91,20,California,Carneros,Merlot
"A pretty Viognier with oaky pear and apricot aromatics, lean, dry and crisp in style with plenty of depth on the finish that will appeal to fans of Condrieu. This wine will be available in 2013.",91,25,California,Fiddletown,Viognier
"There's no oak at all on this Sauvignon Blanc, just lots of clean freshness. What stars is a great burst of gooseberry, grapefruit and peach fruit, accented with zesty acidity. Just delicious, a perfect wine for cocktails and Asian-inspired cuisine.",90,16,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
"Sausal has some of the oldest vines in Sonoma County, and despite ripe raspberry, blackberry, cola and chocolate flavors, this wine has a taste of the earth that must come from the vine roots reaching deep into the soil. It's a lovely, gentle Zinfandel for drinking now.",90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"Tightly wound, but clearly big and bold with massive tannins, this Tempranillo has amazingly dark, brooding fruit and spicy undertones and should develop into a stunner with time.",90,25,California,El Dorado,Tempranillo
"Tart and spicy, the latest release of Adelsheim's iconic Auxerrois opens with grapefruit and lemon zest, shows excellent grip and length, and moves into subtle details of lime, citrus, and ginger. A unique and interesting wine, crisp as a new dollar bill.",90,22,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Auxerrois
"A distinguished, opulent Chardonnay that's a real testimony to the art of blending. Offers waves of orange custard, sweet pineapple tart, crème brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with zesty acidity. Easy to find, with more than 38,000 cases produced.",90,23,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
"If you're used to soft, ripe Napa Valley Cabernet, this one, grown just over the Lake County border, will strike you as dry and unyielding. The tannins are pronounced, giving it a hard bite. But it's rich and deep in crème de cassis, the sort of wine that seems ageworthy. Take a gamble and put it in your cellar for 6–8 years.",90,28,California,Red Hills Lake County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare.",90,19,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"This elegant and detailed Pinot Gris offers fresh floral accents around spicy, toasty, well-mixed fruit. Pear and orange fruit flavors carry just a slight hint of honey, and the concentrated finish extends into a long, clean fade-out.",90,17,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Gris
"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold.",90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"The fruit shines here—pears and apples aplenty—with textural notes of citrus rind. Balanced, with medium length, it's a young, clean, lip-smacking style, with more density than most Oregon Pinot Gris.",90,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Just released after nearly eight years, this wine still tastes lively and timely. It's marked by complex waves of blackberries, mocha, currants, cola and spices, although the fruit is beginning to move into drier, secondary characteristics. It's delicious, and fully ready to drink now. Give it a decanting, and watch as it changes in the glass.",90,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's no oak on this delightfully dry wine, although you'd never know it from the rich streak of vanilla and smoky butter that accompanies the orange, apricot, lime and honey flavors. It's a brilliant success, bright and zesty in acidity, and one of the most satisfying Pinot Gris on the market.",90,17,California,Edna Valley,Pinot Gris
"A voluptuous wine packed with almonds, a handful of herbs and citrus aromas and flavors, this big-boned, dry, barrel-fermented Roussanne finishes with a swirl of lemon. Available in 2013.",90,25,California,Sierra Foothills,Roussanne
"Fruit is the star of this crisp wine. It bursts with pineapples, tangerines, limes and honeysuckle flowers, with a savory touch of vanilla and buttered toast. Best of all is the brisk acidity that highlights the richness.",90,17,California,Sonoma County,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"A somewhat pale wine, at first reluctant to show much aroma, it ultimately reveals itself to be elegant and surprisingly deep. Varietally expressive, with light cranberry and strawberry fruit, dusty tannins, toast, caramel and a whiff of incense. Complex and lovely.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"A beautiful, bargain-priced blend of Tinta Roriz (aka Tempranillo), Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesa and Alvarelhão. Violet and jasmine perfumed, this wine is so, so pretty with just a stunning nose. In taste, there's raspberry, strawberry and lilting layers of pepper and herbs. An intriguing wine well worth trying, made by Morgan Winery Winegrower Dan Lee.",90,16,California,Alta Mesa,Tempranillo Blend
"Off-dry, this succulent wine has you smacking your lips rather than puckering them. The natural acidity buoys up the sweet fruit, a mix of peach and apricot principally, and the wine has an excellent focused core that trails off into suggestions of honeycomb and lemon custard.",90,18,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Riesling
"This is a full-bodied wine that belies the notion that Oregon always makes a sleeker style of Chardonnay. Here are ripe, round flavors of peach and mango, wrapped in naturally vivid acidity, with a warming sensation in the finish. Best enjoyed soon, while fresh and young.",90,27,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Chardonnay
"Shows the fantastic power and extracted fruit that this vineyard is famous for. Just massive in apricots, tangerines and pears, it's enriched with sweet smoky oak, which adds vanilla bean and buttered toast to the richness. Fortunately, brisk acidity and minerality provide balance.",90,23,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"It's classic Alexander Valley, soft, rich and thick in melted tannins, and elaborate in tiers of briary wild berries, milk chocolate, black pepper and sweet charred oak. Easy to drink with everything from burgers and steaks to tacos and teriaki beef.",90,19,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"From an older block (planted in 1990), this tightly-wound, beautifully-structured Chardonnay brings together tart and tasty orange citrus fruits, wet stone minerality, hints of lime and a core of steel. It's a racehorse, beautifully proportioned, and built for both near term and long term enjoyment.",94,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"All Dwelley Vineyard Merlot, with 9% Cab Franc and 6% Cab Sauvignon. Lots of pretty barrel toast and dense purple and black fruits, mixed with spicy vanilla/clove. Tannins are silky smooth, supple and powerful, and the wine really kicks it!",93,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
"Compelling aromas and flavors show a generous amount of toasty oak, dappled with the ground coffee highlights that you find in ripe Cab Franc. Lovely purple fruits, compelling, tight, tart flavors, racy and supple, with juicy fruit/berry flavors, fine tannins, and a smooth, supple, lengthy finish.",93,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"All den Hoed grapes—barrel fermented, neutral oak, no malolactic. Very rich, deep and racy, with glorious fruit. Full-bodied and lush without being heavy; it keeps the freshness and minerality, along with a full range of fruits from citrus to stone fruits to melon. Finishes with a lick of white pepper.",93,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"Firm, spicy and loaded with generous tropical fruits, this has three different clones in the blend, yielding exceptional depth and complexity. The wine moves gracefully from citrus to tropical fruits, with a firm core balanced on juicy acids.",93,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"A unique balance—9.8% alcohol and 2% residual sugar—with the subtle flavors of old vines a bonus. A gorgeous wine, tasted with escalar (white tuna) served as sushi. The buttery fish and the light, elegant Riesling are a stunning match. Neither overtakes the other.",93,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Riesling
"Pey-Marin's Rieslings have been among the greatest in California, and their 2009 is one of their best yet. The wine is entirely unoaked, and did not undergo the malolactic fermentation, but it was aged on its lees. That allows the acidity to star, and what brilliant acidity it is. Rich and bone dry in steel, mineral, slate, citrus, white peach and Champagne yeast flavors, it takes California Riesling in a whole different direction.",93,26,California,Marin County,Riesling
"Wonderfully fragrant, this wine really delivers the goods. Candied citrus fruits, juicy and rich, with an extended middle palate that brings in some skin flavors and hints of stone and earth. The finish extends for a full minute or longer.",93,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Expresses Viognier's ripe, exotically lush side, with strong flavors of tropical papayas and golden mangos, spicy tangerines, Key lime pie and tangy green apple jam flavors. Neutral oak gives a needed touch of creaminess, while a crisp burst of acidity provides clean balance. A beautiful, dry and versatile wine.",92,27,California,Santa Barbara County,Viognier
"Loaded with spice and mint, angular and focused, this extraordinary offering has a core of strikingly deep raspberry fruit. Around that core resonates a shell of minty herb, further defined by sharp tannins with an aromatic sandalwood component. As it breathes in the glass, it opens up further with cured, smoked meat flavors.",92,25,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah
"In the aromas are some organic, composty notes, some violets, and plenty of purple fruits. This wine has extra grip in the mouth, drying tannins, quite ripe and polished, and elevated with beautifully ripe fruit. Veins of licorice and black olive run into the finish.",92,25,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah
"Stillwater Creek may prove to be one of the great Grenache sites in Washington, which is experiencing a state-wide renaissance with the grape. This is a stellar effort, bursting with juicy red fruit, bourbon barrel, candied cherries, and a finishing layer of sweet chocolate. Though it bursts onto the palate with a rainbow of fruit flavor, it persists and shows both depth and length as well. Lovely.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Grenache
"Single vineyard, pure varietal, with the focus and tight profile you might expect. Mineral flavors abound—chalk, graphite, and granite— which underscore the bright cranberry and currant fruit. This is a strikingly pure and well-defined Cab Franc.",92,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"One of the best Pinot Blancs of this or any vintage. It was mostly fermented in stainless steel, with about one-fifth in new French oak. Just beautiful, with the creamy lushness of a fine Chardonnay. The fruit flavor is all about ripe, zesty citrus, spicy pears, tangerines and tangy green apples.",92,24,California,Carneros,Pinot Blanc
"Pure Roussanne; plump and spicy, with beguiling accents of cinnamon around rich fruit. Orange, tangerine and apricot fruits are in full display, the wine is round and luscious and the finish quite full and satisfying.",92,22,Washington,Red Mountain,Roussanne
"A terrific Zinfandel, beautiful to drink now for its soft richness. Flatters the palate with deep, lingering black cherry and raspberry pie filling, vanilla, Indian spice and sandalwood flavors, but is completely dry, with rich, intricate tannins. Only 190 cases were produced, but worth the search.",92,25,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"A terrific Cabernet that shows vast improvement over the winery's earlier efforts. In fact, you could place it next to far more expensive Napa bottlings. It's dry and elegantly tannic and complex, showing blackberry, currant, violet, herb and cedar flavors that bring to mind a fine Bordeaux. Drink now with upscale fare.",92,25,California,Mendocino County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Always one of the superstar Sauv Blancs from Washington, this is especially good in this vintage. Lots of toast, butter cookie and a streak of vanilla are wrapped into silky, seductive, ripe fruit flavors that mix citrus, orange, papaya and lemon hard candy. This is about 20% Sémillon, barrel fermented.",92,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"Lovely aromas, with the depth and dimension that old vine (30-year-old) Riesling can produce. This is ripe, round and well-defined, and packed with stone and citrus fruits, especially grapefruit. Great natural acidity and balance.",92,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Definitely one of the smoothest and most deeply concentrated Petit Verdots to come out of the Pacific Northwest, this Walla Walla winery and vineyard sources these grapes from their McClellan Estate vineyard. It's is pure varietal, silky and packed with rich boysenberry and blueberry fruit flavor. The tannin management is exceptional, and the finish brings in details of coffee, earth and licorice.",92,28,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Petit Verdot
"This fresh, young Syrah is a lovely wine to drink now, at a good price for the quality. It's jammy and forward in cherries, black raspberries and red currants, with hints of white pepper and cocoa. Feels elegant, complex and balanced all the way through.",92,26,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah
"The aromas are less volatile than the 2007 version; this captures the essential varietal character of the Cab Franc grape, with elements of bark, herb and earth. It is more of a wine for purists, where the 2007 is for those who like hedonistic reds.",92,28,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Franc
"This rich, creamy Chardonnay has fine acidity, while a touch of neutral oak adds a background of buttered toast. But the fruit stars, brimming with papayas, mangos, Meyer lemons, limes and pineapples. The finish is filled with honey, and yet is brisk and dry.",92,26,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"The grapes for this wonderful Sauvignon Blanc come from the cooler Oak Knoll region. They were partially barrel-fermented, which gives a creamy, smoky pie crust sweetness to the citrus, tropical fruit, pear and green apple flavors. Production was only 750 cases.",91,24,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This strong and supple Merlot brings finesse and power to play, mixing black fruits with veins of coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of pepper. Small percentages of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc add muscle, but Merlot is the star here, firm and persistent, streaked with smoke and finished with butterscotch.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Primarily '08 Merlot, Syrah, and Cab Franc with some '07 Cab Sauv also. Once again this wine rocks; it has fruit power, punch and presence. The flavors mingle seamlessly, young fruit with an attitude. Spicy, highlighted berry and plum flavors, with baking spice details, and some finishing heat.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Beautifully fragrant, with intense, polished berry and currant fruit flavors, more than a light sniff of fresh mushroom and lovely herbs. This is a truly remarkable effort, elegant and complex. There are nuances of blood, and garrigue, and just the right amount of whole cluster (about 20%) giving definition and texture through the finish.",91,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"Made in a leaner, drier, lighter style than most Russian River Pinots, but the elegance and complexity are very attractive. Shows a white pepper and herbal note to the sour cherry candy fruit, and is balanced with perfect acidity. A beautiful wine to accompany, not overwhelm, fine foods. Production was an astounding 109,000 cases.",91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"The combination of stainless-steel and oak-barrel fermentation has been good for this wine. It's bright and steely in acidity, and lifts the variety's mineral and citrus flavors to new heights, adding a rich level of smoky cream. Just beautiful and versatile at the table, a sommelier's dream wine. Production was a mere 850 cases.",91,22,California,Carneros,Albariño
"Though varietally labeled, this intriguing white Rhône includes 12% each Marsanne and Grenache Blanc. Rich and satisfying, it brings the buttery density of a ripe Chardonnay, but mixes the fruits for more drama—cantaloupe, apricot, banana, and a bit of papaya. A total yum-fest.",91,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"The Hellion is three-quarters Primitivo and the rest Petite Sirah, sourced from a pair of excellent Washington vineyards. An explosion of ripe berries, it coats the palate with effusive fruit, but retains a balance and structure that includes details of spice, espresso, and bitter chocolate. Really well done, and an exceptional value.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Artesa's dual fermentation approach, in which oak-barrel and stainless-steel-tank fermentation are used, has resulted in this startlingly appealing Chardonnay. Braced with Carneros acidity, it shows mineral-infused orange, lemon and mango flavors, with a smooth coating of toasty oak.",91,18,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"This could be called the signature white for Barnard Griffin, for it always delivers astonishing flavor for the modest price. A small percentage of Sémillon is in the blend, but the sappy, spicy, penetrating herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc is showcased, not disguised. Done in a Sancerre-like style, under 13% alcohol, this is a gorgeous food wine, but you may just want to sip on it all by itself.",91,9,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Fumé Blanc
"A perfect framing of fruit and skin and acid, this screams out for the perfect food match. It's a mouthful of orange fruit and orange rind, with lemony highlights and impressive power. It resonates from start to finish, adding notes of herbal tea and orange liqueur as it rolls through a long finish. Outstanding winemaking.",91,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Orange Muscat
"Big and juicy, this full throttle Grenache screams across the palate with a load of spicy cherry, brambly berry, and bourbon-soaked plum flavors. Tannins are toasty and the finish leaves a pleasingly bitter coffee impression.",91,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Grenache
"From one of the coolest vineyards on the Central Coast, this Chardonnay's acidity is brisk and bright. It provides a balance to the enormously rich, long hangtime flavors of pineapples and other fruits that are tropical in their exotic richness. New oak provides the perfect touch of caramel and vanilla toast. A great price for a Chardonnay this good.",91,18,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
"Another solid Syrah from specialist Novy. The wine is notable for its delicious flavors of berries, roasted meats, pepper and cedar, and is elevated by a fine structure. Beautiful tannins, fine acidity, completely dry, and with a smooth, elegant, spicy finish.",91,27,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"Very deep, very dark, with high-toned aromatics and dense black cherry and black fruits. Smoke, toast, dark chocolate, mocha flavors all through it. Good length; the volatility is most apparent in the nose, not in the flavors. Exceptional fruit ripeness and depth.",91,28,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Franc
"An exciting Gewürz, one of the best out there. Shows the variety's exotic spiciness and muskiness, with underlying orange, honeydew melon, lychee, pear and kumquat flavors, brightened by wonderful acidity. No oak was used in the production, and the finish is totally dry.",91,22,California,Russian River Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Pungent aromas of concentrated stone fruits, bubble gum, a whiff of diesel and pine tar introduce a multidimensional wine with lip-smacking acidity. All stainless fermented, no malolactic, no acidification—just a clean, pure, natural and richly delicious wine, loaded with ripe, luscious peach, pear, papaya and apricot fruit.",91,8,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"A first rate Zinfandel. It shows the classic structure, dryness and tannins of a fine Napa Valley Cabernet, yet the pepper, baking spice and wild berry fruit and currant flavors are uniquely Zin. And look at that alcohol, under 14%. Drink this robust, complex wine with steaks, beef stew, tamales.",91,27,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
"A fine expression of Washington Syrah, this is a lighter style, and therefore more detailed with subtle notes of herb, citrus, earth, tart berries and more. There is plenty of acidity, the tannins are polished into the background, and the barrel notes bring in mocha and milk chocolate flavors. Accessible and elegant, this is a fine value.",91,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"A tasty, round, nicely-balanced, fruity style. Flavors are fruit driven, with lots of melon, apple and pear dominating. The acids are just right, and the wine is as clean and fresh as it can possibly be.",91,19,Washington,Red Mountain,Sauvignon Blanc
"The 14% Sauv Blanc really brightens up the Sémillon. Round and fruit driven, barrel fermented in neutral oak, broad and delightfully fruity and open; the flavors mix Satsuma orange, some citrus rind, a bit of peach and buoyant acidity. A very accessible and immediately delicious wine.",91,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sémillon
"Barnard Griffin is family-owned, yet competes, both in terms of price and quality, with the biggest wineries in the state. This Chardonnay is reliable year in and year out, but is especially fine in 2009, with wonderful definition. Fresh herbs, crisp green apple and citrus fruit, a full, spicy, tangy mouthfeel, and above all, a lingering and clean finish, make this a terrific value.",90,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This is pure Sangiovese, from the estate vineyard. This captures the varietal character nicely, with very pretty cherry and cranberry fruit, high acids, and a bright, accessible style. It tastes like young vines, but shows enormous potential, with a pleasing earthiness to the finish. The first Sangio from Barrister.",90,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Sangiovese
"Few Pinots at this price are this nice to drink so soon. The wine is dry and elegant, crisp and silky, offering deep flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, cinnamon spice and sweet, smoky oak.",90,25,California,Arroyo Seco,Pinot Noir
"An excellent mix of Wahluke Slope, Columbia Basin and Royal Slope vineyards go into this blend. A rich nose is loaded with chocolate, sandalwood, and cherry confit. In the mouth this has firm tannins, cassis and plum fruit, a lovely wrap of mocha and a lick of caramel.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"A beautiful wine with a spine of steel and trenchant acidity that demands savory, spicy foods. It's brilliantly ripe in mineral-infused Meyer lemon and spicy green melon, and while it's technically dry, has a rich, honeyed sweetness. Entirely unoaked.",90,20,California,Edna Valley,Grüner Veltliner
"This is a gem—40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 30% Cab Franc. Dense, fruity and salty, it also carries concentrated chocolate and coffee flavors, surrounding very rich cassis and black cherry fruits. A superb value.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Beautifully balanced, this offers the perfect expression of Washington State brightness and a Bordeaux-like herbal component. The tannins are fine and drying, and the wine is polished, with plenty of astringent, herbal flavors in the finish. Don't look for big fruit here, but for a Euro style, this is a sure bet.",90,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Forward and tasty, with violets on the nose and a friendly mix of plum, cherry and cassis fruit, dotted with cut tobacco, and finished with exceptionally smooth and polished tannins. There are chocolaty barrel notes and a seamlessness to the whole wine that shouts quality all the way.",90,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"A really nice Syrah, especially at this price. It's dry, softly tannic and enormously rich in blackberry and cherry-pie filling, red licorice, beef jerky, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. A real pleasure to drink now if you're looking for a medium-bodied red.",90,16,California,Paso Robles,Syrah
"So dry and racy, so mouthwateringly interesting in citrus fruits, green grass and minerals, it makes you think of all sorts of foods to drink it with. Try with vegetable tempura, smoked meats, garlic mashed potatoes, roasted chicken. Production was more than 4,500 cases.",90,16,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Very fine, full and fruity, this is a remarkably flavorful wine. It captures just a hint of the floral/soapy side of the grape, but brings in delicious fruit flavors of peach and pear and melon and more, a luscious mix that continues to resonate right on through a powerful finish. It's just slightly off-dry, but not really sweet.",90,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Gewürztraminer
"Here's a rich, complex and utterly delightful Sauvignon Blanc whose flavors range from Meyer lemons and papayas to green melons and figs. The richness is balanced by fine acidity and minerals, and the finish is nice and dry.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A complex and compelling mix of citrus rind, pineapple, apple and pear, both in the nose and in the mouth. This gathers strength in the mouth, kicking flavors into a higher gear with juicy acidity. A long, tailing finish has a hint of mint and pepper.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"A soft, silky scent to open, weaving a tapestry of floral, musk, lemon polish and apple notes. The wine has excellent concentration, a dense midpalate bringing vanilla cream and banana and other tropical fruit flavors to the front. Powerful, with a hint of volatility.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"There's a textbook quality to this Zinfandel. You could use it in a teaching class as expressing the classic California attributes of the variety. It's perfectly dry, not too high in alcohol, firm in tannins, and deeply flavored in dark stone fruits and berries. And then there are the freshly crushed peppercorns, black, red, green and white. Could be the perfect barbecue wine.",90,16,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel
"Brilliant, mouthwatering acidity marks this refreshingly clean wine. It's very ripe, showing pineapple and lemon sour candy, papaya, green melon and vanilla spice flavors. Straddles the border between bone dry and just off-dry, although the honeyed sweetness might not show up officially. Great with Thai, Vietnamese and Asian-fusion fare.",90,24,California,Arroyo Seco,Pinot Gris
"A little soft and heavy, but dry, with rich, extracted flavors of berry jam, red licorice, milk chocolate and pepper spice. It's a very good, robust Zinfandel for drinking with barbecue and short ribs.",90,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Golden honey, tangerines and orange blossoms perfume this silky smooth late harvest Riesling. Lush stone fruit and honey flavors melt onto the palate, but are anchored by an elegant black tea note and a bright tangerine acidity that make this sweet ambrosia a delightfully long sip.",90,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Robust, full bodied and frankly delicious, this is a great value in an upscale Syrah. It's bone dry, but exceptionally rich in blackberry and cherry-pie filling, currant, licorice, bacon, sandalwood and pepper flavors that are deep and long in the finish. Amazing how good it is for the price. A sommelier's dream, but production was only 248 cases.",90,19,California,Napa Valley,Syrah
"A pretty, polished and crisp Riesling that straddles the line between dry and off-dry. It's high in acidity, making the citrus, green apple, peach and jasmine flavors mouthwatering and clean. A beautiful wine to drink now.",90,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Riesling
"Sirocco is 46% Grenache, 31% Mourvèdre, 15% Syrah, 4% Counoise and 4% Cinsault—is anyone else in Washington doing such complex Rhône blends? The model, of course, is Châteauneuf-du-Pape, and this is a worthy New World take on that wine. Still youthful and very spicy, with tight red fruits, firm tannins, and alcohol pushing 15%, it needs more bottle age and/or decanting to smooth out.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend
"Bill Easton doesn't make this dessert wine every year, so when he does, especially of this caliber, it's a good time to pick up some of this deliciously balanced dessert delight. It's a very nuanced rendering of crisp, clean peach, pear and honey flavors that would go well with fruit desserts or anything involving almond paste.",93,15,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Muscat
"It's unbelievable that this Chardonnay is unoaked, it's so incredibly rich and creamy. Just packed with layers of tropical fruits, peaches, Asian pears and oatmeal cookies. All that butter and cream must be from the malolactic fermentation and aging on the lees. One of the best unoaked Chardonnays ever.",93,29,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"From an especially cool vintage that favored acidity and citrus, this Poet's Leap is a pretty wine, vibrant and full across the palate, with a mix of apple and peach flavors. Clean and balanced, it adds nuances of tea and finally a hint of honey in the extended finish.",93,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Ripeness marks this Pinot. It floods the mouth with jammy raspberries and cherries, brightened with acidity. Seems a bit straightforward by virtue of sheer dazzle, but it is a superb example of the Santa Rita Hills, at a good price.",93,26,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir
"Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer goes where his vinous muses take him and this new wine of his is a perfect example of his “why not” attitude. It contains 56% Nebbiolo from the Sumu Kaw Vineyard as well as 30% Syrah from the same, 9% Mourvèdre, 2.5% Viognier and 2.5% Roussanne. It's jam-packed in a lilting way with fresh, bright strawberry and intense aromas of perfume and freshly picked herbs.",93,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Red Blend
"This wine saw no oak barrel aging, but it's so rich and satisfyingly clean, it's probably better off not being weighed down by caramel and buttered toast. Brimming with brisk acidity, it shows brilliantly pure citrus fruit, tart gooseberry, Asian pear, green apple, mineral and white pepper flavors. The vineyard is in Green Valley.",92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Very rich and opulent, with maybe a touch of botrytis giving the apricot, orange and buttercream flavors a honeyed decadence. Bright acidity keeps it all clean and balanced. Showing exceptionally well for a white wine at 4½ years of age.",92,19,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Blanc
"An unusual and compelling effort, this opens with lush, generous fruit flavors of both red and black berries, highlighted with orange peel. Excellent depth and texture, with a full-bodied middle and palate-pleasing minerality. Gains complexity through a lingering finish.",92,28,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah
"This fruity Syrah is rich in cherries, raspberries, white chocolate and spices. Syrah hardly gets more flamboyant. And yet its structure is firm and pleasant. Drink now–2016.",92,26,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah
"A delicious Zinfandel, one of Fritz's best in years. It shows Zin's robust, briary character, with a peppery, brambly mouthfeel. Yet the long, cool vintage has resulted in sweetly ripe flavors of wild berries.",91,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"This is a very rich, creamy wine. Fermented in stainless steel, the creaminess must come from lees aging. The flavors of orange and apricot jam and zesty lemon tart are dominant, but vital acidity also stars, giving the finish a spicy punch.",91,24,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache Blanc
"With residual sugar at about 1.35%, this balances the acidity without seeming sweet. Hand-picked and whole-cluster pressed, this immaculate, fresh, generous and stylish Riesling is always at the top of the list of Washington's best. Loaded with grapefruit, citrus and stone flavors, it cleans the palate and piles on the details as it rolls into a finish that lingers for well over a full minute.",95,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"What a lovely Riesling. The grapes were grown near the coast, and you can taste the zesty natural acidity, which gives a lift to the orange, lime, mineral and honeysuckle flavors. It's a little sweet, but the finish is dry and spicy. Great to drink now.",91,22,California,San Luis Obispo County,Riesling
"Shows all the hallmarks of a modern Napa wine of high quality. Although it's quite dry, it's rich in crushed ripe blackberries, in good alignment with smoky new oak. The tannins are smooth and complex, the acidity just fine. Really a lovely bottle of red wine, although a touch of superripeness may limit ageability.",91,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"For the price, this is one of the best Santa Lucia Highlands Pinots of the vintage. Just a lovely wine to drink now, showing fine dryness, acidity and silkiness. The flavors are of rose hip tea, cola, sour cherry candy, toasty oak, tobacco and exotic spices.",91,28,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir
"Gewürztraminer is a great success at this Snipes Mountain winery, here done in a full-bodied, fleshy style that discards any hint of floral soap. Vanilla bean, lemon cream, graham cracker and a thoroughly yummy core of ripe fruit mark this as nonclassic, but incredibly delicious.",91,12,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Gewürztraminer
"The Celilo Vineyard is arguably the finest location in Washington for growing Gewürztraminer, and over the years quite a few winemakers from both Washington and Oregon have worked with these grapes. No one does a better job than Chris Dowsett, and this new vintage is his finest to date. A thrilling wine, from the first sniff to the last lingering sip—lemon peel, sappy citrus fruits, rich minerals, perfect acidity— it's all here in spades.",94,22,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Gewürztraminer
"Bonterra is offering up some serious yumminess here, from organic grapes grown in Lake County. The sweet wine opens with a sweet floral nose and a lot of minerality graduating into a concentrated thickness of golden honey-graham flavors.",90,16,California,Lake County,Muscat
"A Chardonnay-based sparkler, this rich and concentrated wine has a luscious mix of apricot, peach and papaya fruit flavors in a creamy, textural setting. Exceptional length and development in the glass, which keeps bringing in nuances such as vanilla and pepper.",90,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sparkling Blend
"A concoction of 66% Zinfandel, 33% Syrah and 1% Viognier that's thick in tannins, meat and dusty earth, or is it earthy dust? The black licorice is mighty memorable.",90,22,California,Humboldt County,Red Blend
"Anderson Valley is better known for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but the cool climate is also good for Sauvignon Blanc. Foursight's 2010 is a delightful wine, vibrant in citrus, tropical fruit and peach flavors, and there's no oak to interfere with its purity. With a finish that seems just a little sweet, it's a fine companion for Asian fare.",90,20,California,Anderson Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Much improved from past efforts, this firm and fruity Tempranillo has a lush core of boysenberry and black cherry fruit. It's finished with screwcap, and may require decanting to push it open, but it will reward your patience with a deep and focused wine that has some cellar potential.",90,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Tempranillo
"Acidity and ripe fruit mark this Chardonnay, which is lovely to drink now. Don't chill it too much, to allow the orange, pineapple and passionfruit flavors to express their nuances.",90,26,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"This Sancerre-like effort shows amazing concentration and distinct, vineyard-driven flavors of grain and herb. Racy, textural, crisp and penetrating, it's lifted by a refreshing minerality. Lemon polish, citrus oil, a very delicate suggestion of honey in the nose and mouth, and above all a wonderful persistence make this a standout Sauvignon Blanc.",93,26,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"This is all Merlot, tight and toasty, with generous black fruits compacted into a dense core. This one needs more bottle age, and/or substantial decanting time, but it shows excellent depth and polish already.",90,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
"Rich doesn't begin to describe this Pinot Gris. It's explosive in orange and apricot jam flavors, with vanilla and buttered toast layers. There's a fat, oily texture that adds interest to a variety that can be simple.",90,18,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Gris
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this wine is all about fresh, vibrant fruit. Limes, Meyer lemons, gooseberries, Asian pears and something tropical, like papayas, all mingle together. Aging on the lees, which is a popular intervention in many unoaked white wines, gives additional notes of cream and sourdough.",90,15,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A standout in a flight of more expensive wines, this five-grape blend leans heavily on the Bordeaux varietals, with a bit of Syrah as well. Firm and complex, its black cherry, cassis and plum fruit flavors are nicely accented by baking spices and red licorice. The balance is perfect; the finish carries a suggestion of dried leaf.",90,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"A lush mouthful of nuanced fruit, this single-vineyard Viognier is loaded with a rich mix of peach, apricot, papaya and guava fruit. Laced into the hefty fruit core are baking spices and cocoa powder, along with suggestions of curry and cumin. This wine should be mandatory with curry dishes.",93,20,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Viognier
"This new vintage of Abeja's estate-grown Viognier is back to a richer mouthfeel after the high acid 2008, with generous citrus and stone fruits—peach and pear—candied lemon and pineapple, highlighted with cinnamon spice. Flat out yummy, roundly fruity, and long-lasting, with butterscotch ruling the finish.",93,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Viognier
"Robust and fruity, this big Syrah floods the mouth with blackberries, currants, bacon and black pepper. It's a delicious wine, wrapped into firm tannins, and ideal with a nice charbroiled steak, with salt and pepper to echo the wine's spices.",90,27,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Syrah
"Good price for a Napa Chardonnay this rich and balanced. It's enormously ripe in pineapples, oranges and golden mangoes, but grounded by zesty acidity and a minerality that comes from the soil.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"This dry, acidic, minerally Chardonnay brings Burgundy to mind. It has a lot going for it, but is rather tight and angular despite a rich vein of pineapple and lemon drop. Distinguished in its way, it's a fine wine, at a great price.",90,25,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
"This is 100% Merlot, and all Red Mountain fruit. Ripe plums and cherries are accented with hints of dried leaves, tobacco, and sweet herb. Baking spices reflect its 20 months in oak, and the wine has a soft finish that is ideal for immediate enjoyment.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Good price for a Napa Valley Cabernet this distinguished. It's rich and satisfying in blackberry, black currant and blueberry fruit, with a lovely coat of smoky oak. Shows lots of complexity, and the finish is dry and spicy. Could go the distance, but just to be safe, drink over the next six years.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a beautiful Cabernet to drink now with a good steak. It's rich and complex in blackberry and black currant flavors, and is very dry, with lingering acidity. The tannins are thick but fine. The best Cabernet from Eberle in memory. Drink now.",92,19,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Released in a half-bottle format, this is the perfect Cabernet for two people to drink over a nice cut of beef. It's dry and stylishly elegant, with impressive blackberry, currant, olive, cocoa and herb flavors.",92,18,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This sturdy, full-bodied Pinot could almost be a Grenache, it's so big and strong. Yet, strangely, there's a silky elegance that tells you it's Santa Lucia-style Pinot. Offers waves of raspberries and cherries and oranges, brightened with zesty acidity. A considerable value given the producer and origin.",92,28,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir
"Opening with fruity, bubble gum scents, this barrel-fermented (in new French oak) old-vine Chenin Blanc has a delicious toasty, bready flavor, sweet lemony acids, and plenty of peachy fruit, without being unctuous or heavy. The broad and toasty mid-palate seems to extend indefinitely; it just never stops.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chenin Blanc
"Stottle does an especially good job with Tempranillo, sourced from the same site as its Nebbiolo. Fruity and fleshy, loaded with bright berry notes, it reflects its 21 months in barrel in its complex streaks of spice, chocolate and butterscotch.",90,26,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Tempranillo
"Yorba is doing the world of Zin lovers a huge favor by holding its wines in bottle for longer than most producers, and what you get for all that waiting is a wine ready to drink that's still got plenty of structure and ageability. This Zin shows great depth, with subdued fruit and darker flavors of plum and coffee allowed to shine, rounded out by an intensity of spice.",90,28,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"A very drinkable, densely lush Barbera that's been given proper time to age and tame its tannins. This wine has dense plum flavors and accompanying layers of spice and earth, a very nice example of mountain-grown California Barbera.",90,28,California,Amador County,Barbera
"If only more California Primitivo could be made in this style - soft, lower in alcohol, modestly showing its fruit - there would be more converts among Zin fanatics, who would be wowed by the subtle black cherry and licorice flavors and dry finish, minimally aged in oak.",90,18,California,Lodi,Primitivo
"They've been doing their homework at Windsor Sonoma to judge by this Cab, which is a vast improvement over past releases. It's a pleasure to drink now for its rich, forward flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants and cocoa, soft tannins, and lush overlay of caramelized oak. It finishes sweetly smooth, although it's technically dry.",92,28,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Syrah is a core strength of Darby, and as with previous vintages, this is dense and aromatic, leading from floral scents into a dark, almost broodingly deep core of blackberries, cassis and pepper. Full-bodied and 14.4% alcohol, this captures the essential strengths of Washington Syrah, done as a fruit-driven, berry-laden style.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Sharp, phenolic and edgy, with bright fruit and intensity, this southern Rhône blend brings in a lush mix of Meyer lemon, tangerine, orange peel, pink grapefruit, and even a little pineapple. With a bit more bottle age, the sharpness should smooth over.",92,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier-Roussanne
"For sheer hedonism, this is one of the best Cabs on the market. This classic Napa Cab is dry, complex and a joy to drink now, framed by elegant tannins. A spectacular bargain. Production was 4,000 cases.",92,15,California,Yountville,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Exceptionally ripe and yet beautifully proportioned, this has a gravelly base under bright red currant and raspberry fruit. Tight and tart initially, it opens into a lush, superripe wine that finishes a bit hard and green but with bright, intense baking spice highlights.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Another of Cameron Hughes' terrific Cabernets at a good price. This wine will easily stand beside Cabs far more expensive, with its dry, crisply complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise, mocha and oak.",92,22,California,Atlas Peak,Cabernet Sauvignon
"From Long Shadows, a rare, barrel-fermented Riesling. Sappy, tart, juicy and stylish, this is loaded with pear, grapefruit and Meyer lemon. The acidity is generous but softened up a bit by the extra oxygen from the fuder.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"The best of Olsen's 2008 reds, this 100% Merlot is generous and forward, with rich cherry and raspberry fruit. Spicy in the nose and in the mouth, it is lightly herbal, adding texture and length, and has the concentration and depth to develop nicely over the next decade.",91,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
"Stella Maris is priced well below the other Northstar wines, but can stand on its own with this kind of quality. Bursting with tangy berries and lively acidity, it feels sculpted and refreshing, deep and lingering. A lick of mocha and a finishing hint of licorice add to the pleasure.",91,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"What's nice about this wine is its bone dryness, and the way the acidity scours and cleanses the palate. It's subtle in citrus, grass and hay flavors, with complex herb, spice and mineral complexities. A superior California Sauvignon Blanc, and a superb food wine.",91,28,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This fine Pinot Noir easily holds its own when tasted against far more expensive bottlings. It's softly silky and delicately structured and enormously rich, offering delicious waves of raspberries, cherries, oranges, cola, beef jerky and black pepper. A perfect Pinot Noir to drink now. Easy to find, with nearly 13,000 cases produced.",91,24,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir
"This is an unbelievable price for a Napa Merlot of this quality. The wine is softly tannic, dry and rich, with crisp acidity balancing complex flavors of cherries, currants, herbs, violets and cedar. Taste this against Merlots costing five times as much, and it will acquit itself well.",91,13,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"Bee pollen, honey mead and lemon polish mingle in the bouquet; turning smooth and supple in the mouth. This is a rich and buttery wine, with excellent acidity behind the ripe fruit. The flavors gather strength as the wine pours over the tongue and down the back of the throat, finishing with a lick of butterscotch.",91,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Marsanne
"What a nice Cab! It's so softly intricate, so complex, so dry and interesting, you just want to drink the whole bottle now with anything related to beef. Shows blackberry, black currant and oak flavors, with a fine balance of acids and tannins, and is ready to drink now.",91,19,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A beautiful, addictively good Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well the variety does in this inland valley, and also how well-farmed the Mauritson Vineyard is. The wine is brilliantly dry and crisp, with complex citrus, melon, fig, vanilla and white pepper flavors. Great value. Production was 1,000 cases.",91,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A very fine 100% Sauvignon Blanc, made with little or no oak influence. It's dry and crisp and attractive, with citrus and tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, and a fine tug of minerals. Combines richness and power with elegance, a rare feat.",91,22,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Great Zinfandel, easily worth the price. Napa Valley still makes the most balanced, claret-style Zins, and this polished beauty is right up there. It's dry and elegantly constructed despite its considerable power, showing rich flavors of wild raspberries and cherries, sweet concentrated red currants, mocha, licorice and scads of peppery spices. Drink now. Production was 1,750 cases.",91,24,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
"A fine Zinfandel, ripe and balanced. The wine shows concentrated wild berry, licorice, fruit liqueur, jam, bacon and spice flavors. Yet the richness is balanced with fine acidity and soft but intricate tannins, and the finish is dry. Drink now–2013 for freshness.",90,24,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend
"The blend is an authentic Port combination of Tinta Madera, Tinta Cão and other local varieties. The Cão alcohol is high but the acidity is rich, just what you want in a wine this sweet. Shows beautiful blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate and brown sugar flavors, with a hint of smoky oak. Drink now.",90,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Port
"Lots of bang for the buck in this rich, fruity Chardonnay. It hits it right down the middle in solid popular appeal, with New World tropical fruit, citrus and peach flavors wrapped into a buttercream texture and liberally accented with smoky oak.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay

A splendid effort that really sets the standard for Washington Pinot Gris.",90,12,Washington,Yakima Valley,Pinot Gris
"The wine is dry, soft, elegant and lovely, with full-bodied black cherry, currant, red licorice and cola flavors. It certainly is one of the best Syrahs you can buy at this price.",90,15,California,Napa County,Syrah
"Nine Hats is a recently-introduced second wine from Long Shadows. Clearly this is great juice, though it is, inevitably, a bit of a mishmash blend. Tannins are a little rough, but as a $25 red this has plenty of high-priced flavor.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Great price for a Russian River Chardonnay of this quality. It's rich and savory in pineapple, Asian pear, green apple and other fruity flavors, with zesty acidity and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Production was 2,400 cases.",90,15,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

It's a good approximation of the winery's more expensive bottlings, with intricately woven citrus, wet stone and spice flavors, brightened with lots of zesty acidity.",90,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Far and away the best yet from this five-year-old site, Syncline's 2009 GV is a remarkable wine. While retaining clear varietal character—light pepper, green herb, and a floral/citrus palate—it brings the vivid brightness of Washington fruit into play, along with a searing acidity and surprising body. All this and low (12.5%) alcohol.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Grüner Veltliner

"In 2009 this single vineyard offering includes 11% Sémillon. It has wonderful texture, and a mix of light herbal flavors that run through a gamut from celery to lemongrass and up into tart citrus fruit. The acidity is generous but not searing; it penetrates but never overpowers. A quintessential food wine.",90,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate.

"Whether or not you consider yourself a fan of varietal Cabernet Franc, this is a wine to explore and to savor. Pure fruit is set amidst generous streaks of herb and earth, framed by firm tannins.

"Full in the mouth, rich with a mix of pastry fruits, fruitcake, baking spices, clove and coffee, this decadent pleasure is like drinking a Christmas cake. Raisins soaked in a Bourbon sauce come to mind, along with plum pudding.",92,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"The soft but flavorful entry into a land of dark fruits, smoke and espresso barely hints at the wine to come.

Pretty red fruit, seductive and lingering, is matched to hints of chocolate from 30 months in neutral barrels.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Barbera

"Tamarack blends grapes from an astonishing number of sites scattered across the length and breadth of the Columbia Valley, and yet makes wines that are distinctive, polished, generous, and focused. The 2008 Merlot includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc.

It's a joyride from start to finish.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"A first for Animale, and a terrific success, despite the almost 16% alcohol.

"It's a shame that so little of this wine is made, as it is a textbook example of a powerful, beautifully balanced Syrah from this tiny AVA in the heart of the Yakima Valley. Black fruits abound, wrapped in a firm, muscular, polished package by fine-grained tannins and a dark chocolate finish.",92,28,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Syrah

"The winemaker pulled out all the bells and whistles, barrel fermenting this Chardonnay, putting it through partial malolactic fermentation, and aging it on the lees.

Shows impeccable balance, at a fair price.",91,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay

"A near replica of the wonderful 2007, and an equally powerful value.

What a bargain, but only 800 cases were produced.",93,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"What a roll Mumm Napa is on with their new releases. This blush wine shows the level of richness and elegance the winery has achieved lately.

Quite a serious Pinot Noir, at a great price.",90,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir

"This is a splendid rendition of Chateau Ste. Michelle's mainstay Cabernet, rich and round, with a sophisticated mix of grapes, including Malbec, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah.

Michelle.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Subtle and fragrant with pretty blackberry and black cherry fruit, this carries hints of leather and earth, with polished tannins and surprising length. It needs extra hours to open fully, but will reward your patience with extended length and grace notes of plum pudding and black licorice.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Buoyantly aromatic with notes of fresh wildflowers, preserved apricots and honey, this dry Riesling made from a tiny single-vineyard crop balances elegant crushed stone and stonefruit flavors with a focused acidity and stark orange peel astringency.

"Awesomely rich, with massive tropical fruit, pear, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors, finished with cinnamon spice. Acidity is high and crisp, and a bright scour of minerals brings balance. Made in the modern style, this is a Chardonnay to drink with lobster and scallops.",92,28,California,Mt. Harlan,Chardonnay

There's also a rich, creamy texture.",91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Gewürztraminer

"A wonderfully drinkable sparkling wine that appeals immediately for its balanced texture and rich flavors. Easy to like for its array of raspberries, limes, vanilla, toast and yeast. The sour lees note is nicely balanced with the sweet liqueur of dosage.",90,20,California,Sonoma County,Sparkling Blend
"It's difficult to understand why Pinot Blanc has not become more of a cult wine in Oregon. Producers such as Ponzi make it in a style that is bright, bursting with citrus and apple fruit flavors, and elevated with a rose garden's worth of floral highlights. This wine would be a perfect start to a holiday meal.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"Amity's dry Gewürztraminer is one of Oregon's finest, and a major strength of the winery. In this new vintage it shows broad and rich flavors, that run the spectrum from floral and spicy to sweetly honeyed. It's dry, make no mistake, but carries an impression of fruit sweetness. The deepening gold color suggests some early oxidation, and the caramel and toasted grain flavors are already at their peak.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Young, tart and vividly bright, this spicy wine brings Asian pear and cool citrus flavors to the forefront. It holds well through a lingering finish, with a crisp, piercing, phenolic grip reminiscent of grapefruit rind.",90,22,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Blanc
"A picture perfect Sauvignon Blanc. Really defines the variety in California, with rich, ripe tangerine, pear, green melon and vanilla spice flavors, brightened with brisk acidity. Shows a lot of complexity and class, and look at that price. Easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced.",90,12,California,Monterey County,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a delicious, brut-style wine, based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It's very rich in strawberry, raspberry and lime flavors, with vanilla and toast complexities, and the finish is honey-sweet and spicy. Great price for a bubbly this elegant.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"Great price for a Cab this good, and surprising that it's nonvintage. Toasty oak stands out, not unpleasantly, and then the blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate kick in. Holds its own among far more expensive Napa Cabernets.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"For years, Foxen has been producing one of the best Chenin Blancs in California, and with this 2009, they have outdone themselves. It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs. Although production was only 575 cases, this wine is worth a special search, especially for sommeliers.",93,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chenin Blanc
"As in past vintages, this is half DuBrul and half Meek vineyard fruit. It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot—this is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock. It strikes me as more typical of Malbec. The tannins are firm and dense, and the fruits are black as coal and laced with tar and smoke.",93,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
"No winery in California has explored this French variety more than Cambiata, and with the '06, they've produced another interesting wine. It has weight and body and tannins, with wild black and red berry, currant, cherry liqueur, Provençal herb, tobacco and roasted meat flavors that finish with sweetness, although the wine is totally dry.",92,28,California,Monterey,Tannat
"The word inky must have been invented for this pure Cabernet Franc, sourced from the Weinbau vineyard (the label is misprinted). In the world of Cabernet Franc, many are called, and few are chosen. This is one of the chosen. Dense, tightly threaded with smoke, earth, black olive, black cherry, cassis and mocha scents and flavors, this nonetheless drinks smoothly. The tannin management is superb, softening up the hard edges without stripping the wine of flavor.",92,29,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Cabernet Franc
"Wow. An incredible (and affordable) example of what Mourvèdre can be in certain nooks and crannies of the Sierra Foothills and in certain hands. Here winemaker and owner Hank Beckmeyer has made a silk mountai wine out of a tough vintage, taking organically farmed Mourvèdre from the folks over at Cedarville (who have their own label too) and made a gorgeous, pure and rich Rhône with perfumed notes of plum, smooth spice and a good dose of earth, all easy on the palate with fresh acidity and a velvety texture. Very little sulfur was used.",93,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Mourvèdre
"You could use this as a teaching tool for classic Sonoma County Zinfandel. It's full-bodied, dry and spicy, with briary flavors of wild berries, mocha, tobacco, leather and exotic spices. More importantly, it's absolutely delicious. The grapes come from Seghesio's best vineyards in the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. At this price, it's an astonishing value, especially considering that production was nearly 80,000 cases.",93,24,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
"A great Petite Sirah, one that continues an amazing string of successes for the winery. Combines the variety's robust and full-bodied berry, cherry, mocha and pepper flavors and bigtime tannins with classic Napa elegance and balance. Drinks beautifully now and will develop throughout the decade. The wine is based on fruit from a century-old vineyard.",93,28,California,Napa Valley,Petite Sirah
"A wonderful red wine, full-bodied, dry and elegant. It shows Cabernet character in the blackberries, cherries and black currants, but that's balanced with an earthiness and minerality and even some smoked meat notes that must come from a percentage of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Tasted in a flight of much more expensive Cabs, this one easily stood out. Drink now–2011.",92,16,California,Mendocino-Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows the weight, complexity and sheer deliciousness that this bottling almost always displays. Chardonnay fans will love the oaky, creamy flavors of pineapple tart, pear and lemon jam and buttered toast. The winemaker recommends pairing with black cod, and if you have a Chinese restaurant that makes a good version of this honey and soy inspired dish, it will be heaven.",92,26,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
"This is a lovely Chardonnay, a super restaurant wine list bottle. Dry and creamy, it offers pleasantly rich pineapple, lime pie, green apple, exotic spice and buttered toast flavors, accented with crisp, clean acidity.",92,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel, explosive in wild forest berries, perfectly ripe and picked under the summer sun. It's softly smooth, with rich tannins and a long, sweetly spicy finish. Ed Sbragia has mastered the difficult art of elevating Dry Creek Valley. Drink now–2015.",93,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Quite an interesting Chardonnay, in an era when so many are too sweet and extracted. There's plenty of orange and apricot fruit flavor, but also a brilliant streak of minerality, like a lick of cold steel, and the overall taste is dry. Really easy to like, with lots of complexity to warrant repeated sipping.",92,28,California,Oak Knoll District,Chardonnay
"Fruity, dusty and soft, a dark cherry and plum Graciano grown and made in Lodi with great depth, balance and earthiness. The grape is native to Rioja where it is usually blended with Tempranillo, but does deliciously here on its own. From Lodi Rules Certified Green grapes.",92,21,California,Mokelumne River,Graciano
"This is estate grown, from a Lake Chelan winery in an emerging region. Riesling is clearly a strength, as this has a delicate elegance often missing from the fruit bombs that can be grown in warmer sites. Bone dry, dusty and lightly floral in the nose. The balance of blossom, yellow fruits, juicy acidity and wet rock is impeccable; the wine extends itself gracefully into a lingering finish.",92,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Aromatically forward and lush, this greets you with lemon polish, beeswax, Satsuma oranges, and Key lime, backed with barrel-influenced coconut flavors. The flavors meld together in the mouth, holding firm with extra phenolic density through a lip-smacking, luscious and lingering finish.",92,21,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"Earns a high score for sheer richness and decadance. Huge in blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, bacon, pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into big, velvety tannins. Impresses for its size, but is totally dry, and retains balance and elegance. Now–2015.",92,25,California,Paso Robles,Syrah
"Almost all of California's best Viogniers are oaked, but not this one. As with Tangent's previous bottlings, it just shows that this particular wine doesn't need wood to be opulent and completely satisfying. With brisk, clean acidity, it displays complex citrus, white peach, green apple, wildflower and mineral flavors. What a wonderful wine, and a worthy followup to the sensational 2008.",92,17,California,Edna Valley,Viognier
"Most of this Sauvignon Blanc was tank fermented, but a portion received oak. That gives a welcome layer of smoky richness and vanilla to the beautiful, underlying Meyer lemon, lime, pear and green apple flavors that are so rich and mouthwateringly tart. A very drinkable, dry white wine.",91,14,California,Sonoma County,Fumé Blanc
"A worthy followup to the wonderful 2006. Shows equal concentration of blackberry, blueberry and licorice flavors, with a bacon and pepper savoriness that tantalizes. The structure is fine and firm, the finish dry and spicy. Drink now for sheer deliciousness.",91,16,California,Mendocino County,Syrah
"This pure varietal, single-vineyard, barrel-fermented wine perfectly captures the baseline flavors and qualities of the best Washington Sémillons. Complex and slightly high-toned, it brings ripe stone fruits, a hint of honeyed tea, impressive length and penetration, and a waxy, polished, lingering finish.",91,20,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Sémillon
"Absorbingly complex with racy, textural, mineral-driven flavors, this excellent wine features fleshy apple and pear fruit, crisply defined and extended. The low alcohol—just a tad over 13%—keeps the acids front and center; the wine is immaculately fresh, with just a touch (0.7%) of residual sugar.",92,12,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"For the second year in a row, Decoy has released one of the best values in Zinfandel of the vintage. This year, Sonoma County is source to the grapes, and the wine shows classic wild berry, cola, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors. Most remarkable is the tannic structure, which is smooth and distinguished. Easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced.",91,22,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
"Also known as Mourvèdre. This Spanish-inspired Monastrell from Bokisch, grown on a hillside, is brawny with plenty of earth and bacon bite to it, yet also floral, rich yet also bright, tasting of black cherry and pomegranate with a menthol tobacco chaser.",91,21,California,Clements Hills,Monastrell
"A surprisingly perfumed, well-integrated and delicious Cab from the Santa Monica Mountains, where newcomer Howard Leight is starting to craft some superb juice. With some room to grow, this wine has plenty of elegant red plum and anise and its tannins are present but not overwhelming. Grab a steak and give it a go, especially at the price.",91,28,California,South Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This big, soft, delicious Syrah tastes like a candy bar. It's rich and sweet in blackberry jam, blueberry pie with the crust, cocoa and spice flavors, with an umami tanginess like bacon. Easy to savor it through the entire bottle, although the alcohol level is high.",91,27,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter. The berry/cherry fruit flavors are woven into a tapestry of earth, herb and spice, smooth and detailed, and the wine has a mouth-pleasing seamless quality that invites another sip, and another.",91,26,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
"This is pure Chardonnay, from cool-climate sites, showing a lean, sculpted spine that both defines and expands the flavors. Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Kudos to Jorian Hill for crafting a rosé that's truly dry. It's a sophisticated, elegant blush wine with subtle raspberry, herb, rose petal, spice and mineral flavors, finished with a wonderfully clean scour of acidity. This Provençal blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre is one of the best rosés of the yearn and is reasonably priced.",91,18,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Rosé
"Bright and earthy, dense and dark, this New World Tempranillo has an Old World soul, with dark cherry and strawberry going on as well as a touch of cocoa and tobacco. Its acidity adds a spark on the finish; this Ribera del Douro native grape seems plenty happy in the middle of California, at least in Bokisch's hands.",91,21,California,Lodi,Tempranillo
"Good price for such a lush, likeable Merlot. It's soft and rich in cherries, red currants and licorice. This is easly the best Sebastiani Merlot in many years.",91,24,California,Alexander Valley,Merlot
"Hard to explain why this Cabernet is so good at such an affordable price, but there you are. It's dry, smooth and complex in blackberry, black currant, mineral and oak flavors that are a joy to drink now with your best beef dish. Easy to find, with almost 31,000 cases produced.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Marked by big, ripe, juicy blackberry, raspberry and currant fruit, this single-vineyard Syrah is saved from simplicity by two things. There are complex notes of bacon, sautéed mushrooms, black pepper and smoky oak, and the tannins are wonderfully rich and ripe. Really delicious. Probably best soon, though, before the fruit fades.",91,23,California,Dry Creek Valley,Syrah
"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), lined with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.",91,19,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Novy's Syrahs have really hit their stride lately. This one, from this little Sonoma County appellation, is soft and rich in blackberries, blueberries and Canadian bacon, with a smoky layer of charred oak. It is, in a word, delicious.",90,27,California,Bennett Valley,Syrah
"What a great red wine, just about perfect for steak. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with big, ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors. A little rustic, yes, but terrific for drinking now, and easily one of the best California Malbecs ever. And look at that price.",90,20,California,Alexander Valley,Malbec
"Mer Soleil's Chardonnay grapes dependably get so ripe, they offer explosive flavors even without oak. You won't miss a thing without that barrel. The pineapple, orange and golden mango flavors are delicious on their own, and even offer a hint of vanilla. A mouthwateringly fresh squeeze of acidity makes everything bright and clean.",90,24,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"Like the label says, this Viognier is sweet, with honey, apricot, orange and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with fine acidity. Give it more concentration, and the score would soar. Still, it's a very nice dessert wine for the price.",90,19,California,Russian River Valley,Viognier
"Scents of licorice, coffee and tobacco move into concentrated blueberry and cassis fruit flavors that wrap into a tannic, chewy midpalate. The fruit here is outstanding, and the wine delivers excellent, clean, concentrated flavors at this price point. An outstanding value.",91,20,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Red Blend
"A really nice, elegant Chardonnay at a good price. The wine is dry and lightly oaked, showing rich pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors enhanced with crisp acidity. Only 731 cases were produced of this lovely, food-friendly wine.",91,22,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"Tangent makes the best, most consistent unoaked Sauvignon Blanc in California. The 2009 is another classic, offering brilliantly clean, crisp flavors of citrus fruits, green apples and gooseberries. Just beautiful.",91,13,California,Edna Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a beautiful wine from the nose on out. Complex and aromatic, it has Italian-style tobacco scents, fresh acidity, leafy highlights, and undertones of tar, licorice and clove, all wrapped around tart, pie cherry fruit.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Blended with 17% Sauvignon Blanc, this lovely Sémillon is exceptionally fragrant, satiny and rich, with fleshy, ripe fruits and just a hint of toast. A warm streak of caramel enlivens the finish, which lingers gracefully and fills the palate with delicious flavors of apples and spicy pears.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"A fine Chardonnay, creamy, flavorful and complex. It's as soft as buttercream, yet a vital streak of acidity brightens the tropical fruit and vanilla richness. Showcases the Santa Rita Hills in a good, cool vintage.",90,25,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"Sourced about equally from Kiona (on Red Mountain) and Rosebud (in the Wahluke Slope), this deep, dark, well-made Syrah offers exception value. The fruit is plenty ripe, a mix of berries, raisins and plums; there is a generous chocolate note, firm tannins, and the grapes' earthy, lightly funky side displayed as well. It's all beautifully balanced.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Made with no oak, this pretty wine stars fresh fruit and clean acidity. With orange, honeysuckle, melon, mineral and vanilla flavors, it has a mouthfeel midway between a crisp Sauvignon Blanc and a creamy Chardonnay. Production was low, only 559 cases, but worth a search.",91,17,California,Edna Valley,Grenache Blanc
"A beautiful Syrah, richly textured and delicious. Held back for three years, it's perfect now for the soft texture, and the raspberry, cherry and orange zest flavors have a spicy edge. Complexity is enhanced with additions of Petite Sirah, Sangiovese, Barbera, Grenache and Viognier.",90,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Syrah
"This deservedly popular value bottle gets the star Pinot treatment—nine months in French oak, 27% new. It's spicy and full-flavored, with resonant blue plum fruit, buttery toast and a tannic frame.",91,21,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"Tart aromas of sour cream, yogurt, candied lime and pressed quince show on the nose of this stylishly structured Chardonnay. The palate carries the theme forward, with pithy pink grapefruit notes, lime ade and brie rinds, showing firm tension on the tongue and bound-up energy that will keep this bottle alive for years.",91,16,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Chardonnay
"From the only estate in Sonoma County growing the variety, this full-bodied white was aged in a combination of neutral French oak and stainless steel. Sly on the nose, it opens slowly with a whiff of sour apple and a squeeze of lemon, an intensity of savory dill and white pepper at its core.",91,26,California,Sonoma Mountain,Grüner Veltliner
"The winemaker has said he makes Russian River Valley Pinot Noir to support his Syrah habit. Here he offers a compelling case in point, making a velvety, substantial 100% Syrah that's more elegant than overpowering. Mocha-kissed tannins play nicely with black and red berry fruit, providing a structure built to age, through 2021.",91,29,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high.",91,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Concentrated and complex, this is a layered and packed wine. Dark chocolate, black cherry and pomegranate flavors are animated by a lively current of fine tannins, fresh acidity and full body. It includes 24% Cabernet Sauvignon. Delicious now, but will improve through at least 2018.",91,17,California,Mendocino,Merlot
"From the Napa side of Carneros, this Merlot is blended with 1% Petit Verdot, which presumably has added a smidgen of weight and color to the mix. Supersoft, the wine is well-rounded in ripe cherry and blueberry notes, with ample acidity, textured tannins and a strong finish that's awash in mocha flavor.",91,27,California,Carneros,Merlot
"Made in an Alsatian style from a 150-plus-year-old estate vineyard, this dry, well-crafted white is 90% stainless-steel fermented, with the rest fermented in neutral oak. It conveys jasmine and ripe stone fruit, crisp, clean with very little oak intrusion and sharply etched acidity. Flavors of pear and green apple mark the finish.",91,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Gewürztraminer
"Light bodied and highly aromatic in petrol, waxy apple and pear, this vineyard-designate is crisp and floral, with buoyant acidity. It lists the residual sugar at 9 g/L but tastes more dry than sweet, finishing with a touch of cream.",91,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Riesling
"Waxy pear and white plum provide the fruit-forward flavors of this wine, which exhibits plenty of minerality on the midpalate before offering a wave of richness and vanilla cream. The finish finds a focus and balance between these two ends, ending light and bright.",91,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay
"The largest production offering of this variety for this producer, this features fruit sourced from a who's who of local growers, including Sangiacomo, Dutton and Martinelli, in addition to the estate-run Wildcat Mountain Vineyard. The result is satisfyingly impressive in viscous oak, graham cracker and Meyer lemon. Tangy and flinty on the finish, it's smooth and focused.",91,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"Who puts their lowest-priced Pinot Noir in 20% new French oak, and includes fruit from their best vineyards in the blend? Ponzi does, and the result is a terrific vintage for Tavola. Bright, compact, aromatic and lushly fruited with plum and black cherry, this is a stunning value. Cola, caramel and cinnamon spice add further details and highlights.",91,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"Ripe aromas of honeydew are cut down the middle with a pointed petrol note as well as lime skins and grapefruit pith. The palate on this bottling from popular Riesling source Kick-On Ranch is wound up very tight, showing lime skins, focused acidity and a gray-rock minerality. This would go great with shellfish now, or continue to emerge and uncurl in the cellar from 2018–2030.",91,28,California,Santa Barbara County,Riesling
"Light banana flambée, vanilla meringue and yellow-cake aromas show on the generous but not overbearing nose of this blend of 49% Grenache Blanc, 31% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 8% Marsanne. The tropicality of the nose disappears on the palate, which is tart and grippy with green apple and Anjou pear flavors as well as a touch of melon and smoke.",91,20,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style White Blend
"This 100% varietal comes from two standout vineyards—Boushey (70%) and Red Willow.Made with native yeast and barrel-fermented, it is aromatically mesmerizing with kiwi, lemon oil and herbs. As opulent as the aromas seem, the wine is quite restrained in style with a panoply of citrus and stone fruit flavors framed by vivid, mouthwatering acidity.",91,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine from the Fess Parker-owned Rodney's Vineyard shows inky purple color, offering slightly reductive aromas of tar and charred meat but also violets and black pepper. It's full on the palate, hitting first with purple fruit and dried purple flowers before delivering plum-skin acidity and peppery spice. It's an attention-grabber.",91,28,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah
"A light golden hue, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of toasty barrel spices, apricot and dried mango. It's full bodied, almost unctuous in feel, with abundant, sweet stone-fruit flavors and a lingering finish.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"A terrific value in a benchmark Oregon Pinot Gris, this is bright and refreshing, with the palate-cleansing minerality that characterizes all of the Adelsheim white wines. Jicama and melon and pear fruits mingle seamlessly, and the wine's texture and length are impressive.",91,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"A superb value, this estate-grown Pinot brings dense fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry, sourced from Dijon clones. Firm and slightly high-toned, it spent 17 months in one-third new oak, resulting in baking-spice notes that unfold on the finish.",91,22,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Noir
"Beautifully balanced between maturity and freshness, this elegant bubbly combines appetizing cherry, almond and ginger flavors with a suave texture and long finish. It achieves a level of personality and sophistication beyond simple fruitiness.",91,20,California,Mendocino County,Sparkling Blend
"Massively fruity, this is an apple/pear bonanza, fleshy and almost lasciviously delicious. The huge fruit flavors convey an impression of sweetness, though this is not identified as off dry. It has tremendous density and length.",91,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"This wine over-delivers in quality for the price. It's made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blended in to good effect. The whole combines into layers of chocolate and graham cracker, dappled in vanilla and jam. Thick tannins suggest a swirl or two of the glass. The finish is all tobacco.",91,28,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a soft and intense Pinot Noir from three different appellations that's affordable and approachable. It's well-made, with earth, candied citrus and Bing cherry notes intermixed with hints of anise and subtle oak.",90,25,California,San Luis Obispo-Sonoma-Monterey,Pinot Noir
"Made from 90% Chardonnay, the remainder Pinot Gris, this light-golden sparkler is well-composed, with a maturity on the palate leaning towards flavors of almond and anise. Floral and creamy, it has buoyant acidity that gives an impressive lift.",90,22,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"There is a very fleshy fruit smell on this wine from west of Paso Robles, with Meyer lemon and barely ripe melon aromas. The palate is nicely wide and ripe, with flavors of lemon-sprayed nectarines but also with elements of honey butter and honeysuckle that are reminiscent of oak.",90,20,California,San Luis Obispo County,Pinot Gris
"Hints of waxy white florals and lemon zest persist from nose to finish on this intensely revitalizing semidry Riesling. Tart stone-fruit flavors penetrate the palate, highlighted by a stream of spine-tingling acidity.",90,17,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"On the big and bold side, this has abundant fruit flavors surrounded by equally abundant lip-smacking tannins, great acidity and a long finish. Not very oaky, it has a vibrancy and fruit focus that is mouthwatering and compelling. It's tasty now, but will also improve through 2017.",90,15,California,Mendocino County,Merlot
"The aromas on this wine by Bryan Babcock find an intriguing balance between ripe nectarine flesh and tart stonefruit skins. It's a bit more lush in style than other Pinot Gris of the vintage, quite broad on the palate, with apple-pear flavors, lingering lemon skin bitterness and an acidity that soaks into the tongue.",90,25,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Gris
"This is complex, delicious, bold and tannic, bringing the big structure that is expected without being heavy handed. It offers concentrated blackberry and fig aromas, richly jammy flavors that stay dry and a tannic but not tough texture.",90,16,California,Livermore Valley,Petite Sirah
"A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility.",91,22,California,Knights Valley,Syrah
"This is complex, delicious, bold and tannic, bringing the big structure that is expected without being heavy handed. It offers concentrated blackberry and fig aromas, richly jammy flavors that stay dry and a tannic but not tough texture.",90,16,California,Livermore Valley,Petite Sirah
"From a warm vintage, this aromatic offering has notes of candy corn, corn silk, pear and tropical fruit. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors that have a creamy feel and lead to a lingering finish.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Sourced from all over the Napa Valley, this wine blends 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 1% Syrah and other unnamed red varieties. The effort works, resulting in a glass of concentrated red cherry, herb and spice, the tannins tight yet approachable enough for the wine to remain juicy.",90,25,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a mineral-driven take on the grape by Westside Paso vintner Michael Gill, with sharp wet stone and grapefruit peel aromas. The palate is tightly wound and very fresh, with flavors of lime juice and lemon zest.",90,24,California,Paso Robles,Viognier
"The aromas on this wine by Bryan Babcock find an intriguing balance between ripe nectarine flesh and tart stonefruit skins. It's a bit more lush in style than other Pinot Gris of the vintage, quite broad on the palate, with apple-pear flavors, lingering lemon skin bitterness and an acidity that soaks into the tongue.",90,25,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Gris
"Beautifully crafted, this is racy and mineral-soaked. Mountain herbs are in abundance, along with clean, green (in a good way) berry, banana and pineapple fruit. It's balanced throughout, with excellent length and texture.",90,25,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Blanc
"Stainless-steel fermented, this wine remains pungently aromatic in woody, earthy tones, with accents of fragrant orange blossom and pear, while staying crisp and light on the palate. Honey and lemon combine on the complex finish.",90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Though 28 g/L of residual sugar is indicated, this lushly fruity and thoroughly delicious wine does not seem at all sweet, and just barely off dry. Peaches and pears combine in a lightly spicy but intensely flavorful wine with a myriad of food pairing possibilities, notably Thai noodle dishes, or poultry with a fruit sauce.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Gewürztraminer
"This 100% Dijon-clone bottling offers a bold mix of peach, banana and pineapple. It's fruit-driven from top to bottom, with supporting acids to keep it fresh and invigorating.",90,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay

"Enticing aromas like salted nuts, exotic fruit flavors and a generous viscosity in the texture make this a luxurious and distinctive wine.

"This falls sbetween a rosé and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing.

A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish.",90,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris

This needs to breathe, but once it opens, it will thrill you until the last drop.",94,24,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Chardonnay
"This Viognier is easily Maison Bleue's best yet, and it sets a high standard for every Viognier in the state. It's superrich and concentrated without being fat, jammy, bitter or hot.

Details of mineral, baking spice and honeysuckle add interest.",94,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier

"Subtlety and reserve drive this full-bodied, round-textured white Rhône-style blend. The velvety mouthfeel is almost more notable than the subdued pear, melon and butter flavors.

It leads with 49% Marsanne, plus Viognier, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc.",92,25,California,Sierra Foothills,White Blend
"Coming from a vineyard first planted by Mondavi in the late 1990s, this well-priced and widely available wine shows blackberry, violets, black pepper and just snapped dark chocolate on the nose.

"Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025.",90,28,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Chardonnay
"This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip.

"Made from a blend of grapes from the estate's top vineyards, this vivacious dry Riesling balances crisp mineral tones against ripe, tropical notes of mango, pineapple and melon.

"Rich and floral, this top-notch Pinot Blanc hits the palate with verve and ripe, complex fruit flavors. There's a streak of delicious vanilla under the honeydew and Meyer lemon richness, and the length and power are especially impressive for a Pinot Blanc.",92,21,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"One wishes that Mike Januik made more Rieslings, as the few he's made from Bacchus Vineyard fruit have been excellent.

"Chestnut Hill is the winery's highest-elevation vineyard, and in a fine vintage such as this, it merits reserve-level treatment. It would be wonderful if more Oregon wineries made Pinot Gris of this caliber, and could sell it at an approachable price, but it's a tough category. Latch onto this rich and concentrated gem if you can; it's a gorgeous mix of apple, pear, chalk and lightly toasted almonds.",92,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"From the beguiling aromatics to the thrilling palate that's saturated with flavors of citrus flesh and rind, tangerine and green apple, this Viognier offers superb focus. The length and detail are noteworthy, but the taste is simply delicious.",92,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"Roughly half of the blend is made from fruit that comes from 30-year-old vines. An addition of 6% Muscat adds a scent of tree fruit, and the lovely citrus and stone fruit flavors are enhanced by a fresh-baked bread note. It has excellent concentration and impeccable balance, plus a long, satisfying finish.",92,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"An Eastside Lodi Zin classic with its retention of high acidity and tight tannins, this is a complex wine with spicy leather, black tea and bright raspberry flavors.

"This is quintessential Napa Petite Sirah. It's the color of a moonless midnight, showing only some purple at the glass's rim. The tannins are huge and mouth-numbing, while the flavors are extravagantly rich with black cherries and dark chocolate. This is a wine you surely want to cellar. Drink from 2016 and beyond.",91,28,California,St. Helena,Petite Sirah
"A real flatterer, this is instantly appealing for its upfront raspberry, cherry and currant flavors. There's subtlety to the acid-tannin structure, and it finishes with notes of dried herbs and tobacco. This needs a few years to come together.",92,28,California,Edna Valley,Pinot Noir

It's from the owner's estate vineyard, sought after by many other producers and made by Siduri's Adam Lee.",91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Luminous is an apt word to describe this sun-kissed, blossomy wine chock full of plump yellow peach, mango and pineapple flavors. There's so much more beyond fruit here though. A strike of lemon-lime acidity cuts through the palate, lending balance and vibe. The finish is long, accompanied by a delightfully astringent kick of lime zest.

"This is made from fruit that was sourced from the same vineyard and picked at the same brix level as Foundry's Stainless Chardonnay bottling. But here the toast of new oak adds a lovely flavor to the smooth butterscotch and apple notes. It opens gracefully and quickly, but the Stainless bottling has more grip and complexity.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Chardonnay
"This bone-dry-tasting wine is made from grapes that were sourced from the Alayt Vineyard. It marries light hints of flowers to notes of citrus, apples and pears, which taste more like the fruits' textural skin than its sweet flesh. The impressive minerality, depth and length elevate this bottling to the A-list of Washington Rieslings.",92,17,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
"Focus and elegance are the hallmarks of this wine, and it offers the fruit purity that characterizes virtually all of Maison Bleue's white wines. From the first sniff to the last, resonating swallow, this smells and tastes like a bowl full of peaches, pineapples and mixed stone fruits. It's tight and defined, and it doesn't have new oak influence.",92,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay

Drinks well now but should mature well through 2020.",91,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This wine offers caramelized apple, seared pear, honeysuckle, a touch of buttercream and vanilla ice cream on the even, well-measured nose. The flavors lean more green but not underripe, with lime juice, green apple and green mango, offering some bitterness and an alkaline/iodine character.",91,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"Done in a more oxidized style, this wine shows marzipan, dried apricot, browned butter, dried pineapple and a gunmetal flint character on the nose.

"This 100% varietal wine, fermented and aged in stainless steel, is silky and creamy, with a medium body and texture that retains a sizzle of freshness on the palate. Well balanced, it offers melon, green apple and lemon, with a tease of fresh-cut peach, ending crisp and clean.",91,20,California,Napa Valley,Albariño

Orange, grapefruit and lemon give it a sizzling refreshment and high level of acidity, while the texture of the wine stays smooth and luxurious.",91,22,California,Dry Creek Valley,Rosé
"Truchard has produced a Roussanne for many years, but the quality seems to vary according to vintage. The 2012 is a very good wine. It's dry, yet honeyed, with orange, peach and white-flower flavors. The texture is creamy, but highlighted with brisk acidity. It would be a great accompaniment to rich, complex dishes, but a simple roasted chicken would be wonderful as well.",91,25,California,Carneros,Roussanne
"Run, don't walk, to find this Sauvignon Blanc. It's delicious, and available for such a great price! The palate treads an exciting line between ripe peach, citrus, green apple and honey flavors, and a tangy, flinty minerality. The acidity is mouthwatering. Only 550 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",91,16,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is Marimar's unoaked Chardonnay from the estate vineyard. In keeping with past vintages, it's so rich and savory, you won't even notice the absence of barrel influence.

"This has great viscosity and bracing minerality, plus a tongue-tickling texture. The refreshing palate offers gooseberry and melon notes, which combine to make this a go-to Sancerre substitute. One can only hope production increases from the miserly two barrels that were made in this vintage.",91,20,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot. Intricate aromas of vanilla, cedar, powdered chocolate, pipe tobacco and black cherry lead to focused, layered fruit and barrel flavors that show persistence.",91,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"A blend of Grenache from Angiolina Farm and Upland vineyards along with 22% StoneTree Mourvèdre, this wine offers aromas of violets, raspberry, plum and assorted herbs.

"Blackberry, boysenberry, smoke and grilled meat flavors fill this rich, well-balanced and medium to full-bodied wine. The aromas are charming and appetizing, making it seem ready to drink now. However, the mouthfeel is very firm with tannins and acidity, signaling that the wine should age well through at least 2020.",91,24,California,Amador County,Syrah

"The 2011 vintage was difficult for lots of producers, but Brander's Syrahs are some of their finest ever.

If it was from Napa Valley, it would cost a lot more.",90,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah

"Polished and balanced, this masterpiece shows restraint and it's already drinkable. With its great acidity and its fine intermingling of spice and red fruit flavors, this wine will appeal to lovers of Gamay and Pinot Noir.",91,29,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir
"Lush and round, floral and fruity, this only hints at residual sugar. The acidity makes for a bracing palate that offers highlights of clover and honeysuckle, plus rich notes of stone fruits.",91,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Gewürztraminer
"Made from fruit sourced from the well-known Paragon Vineyard, this 100% Albariño is smooth and spicy, and its brilliant acidity highlights the green apple, citrus and vanilla flavors. Try this as an alternative to Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc.",91,24,California,Edna Valley,White Blend
"This perfumed Riesling entices with lifted white floral notes against a backdrop of cool, foresty green notes. It's forward and juicy, boasting honeyed yellow peach and apricot flavors. Yet it's also elegantly structured, marked by zesty citrus notes and a cool, mineral finish that lingers endlessly. Drink now–2020.",91,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This is the inaugural release from this project that pairs Chateau Ste. Michelle with Rhône stars Michel Gassier and Philippe Cambie. Coming from a variety of vineyards across the Columbia Valley, it offers aromas of black cherry, smoke, incense and cocoa. The flavors are plush in feel with a finish that lingers—an impressive first offering.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Aromas of herb, cedar, mushroom, anise and cherry are reserved on this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend. It's supple in feel, with well-balanced dark-fruit flavors and tart acidity that draws out the finish.",91,26,Washington,Red Mountain,Red Blend
"The inaugural release from this négociant winery is a blend of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah. The aromas pop with notes of black pepper, marionberry and herbes de provence. Flavors are fleshy and fruit-forward with a snap of acidity that pulls it all together.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Rhône-style Red Blend
"From the producer's estate ranch, a coveted source of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a 100% stainless-steel wine, low in ripeness, that's enthusiastic in watermelon, cherry and strawberry, smelling like summer. Dark pink-red in color, it's crisp, light, tangy in acidity and everything you want in a quaffing wine.",91,19,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"Made from Syrah grapes with purpose, not as a saignée, this is an alluring wine, its aromatics exuberant in wild strawberry and rhubarb, with a pithy, textured vibe. With just the right amount of power and body, it's vibrant and yet has body and weight, retaining substance through the long finish.",91,25,California,Napa Valley,Rosé
"Ripe fruit flavors and a gorgeously rich texture make this full-bodied wine difficult to resist. It smells like Pippin apples and toasted almonds, tastes more like Bosc pears with a layer of cream on top, yet it's dry and well balanced.",91,18,California,Mendocino County,Viognier-Roussanne
"Dwelley Vineyard provides most of the fruit for this Merlot. Toasty barrel aromas are at the fore followed by exotic spices, milk chocolate and cherry. The flavors are plush and jammy, lingering on the finish.",91,29,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
"This is the first, and least expensive, of the winery's 2010 Cabs. For $20, you get a dry, smooth, opulent wine, filled with classic black currant, tea and oak flavors.",90,20,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"“No oak/No malo” the label proclaims, as if to challenge you to like it anyway. What's not to like? Fresh, leesy notes cleanse the palate, and set up the palate for the mix of melon, blood orange and pineapple that defines the flavors. Without any oak or buttery malo, what persists is the vivid, supple acidity.",90,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"This wine has just enough residual sugar to take it to the upper threshhold of dry. It's quite full flavored with a thirst quenching mix of citrus, apple and pineapple. Crisp acidity enhances the freshness and contributes a tangy, lemony kick to the finish.",90,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"This Syrah is rounding into its prime drinking window. Purple and black fruits abound, with teasing streaks of anise, clove and espresso. Lush and precise, this has excellent length, and although it's drinking beautifully right now, it can age further.",91,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Classic Smith-Madrone Riesling, this is dryish and clean, with mouthwatering acidity and hints of citrus, Asian pear, green apple and honey. It shows balance and elegance that is rare in California Riesling. Enjoyable now, and it should slowly develop nuances over the next eight years.",91,27,California,Napa,Riesling
"Made in fairly modest quantities, this Merlot bears dark fruit that shows a pleasing, dusty quality. The blend includes 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, which keeps it in the Bordeaux-style camp. Firm and concentrated, it finishes with a tasty mix of cocoa, coffee grounds and Asian spices.",90,25,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Merlot
"This single-vineyard 100% Cabernet Franc is firm, juicy and focused. It has a phenolic bite at the back end, along with lemony acids. The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"Clean, tart and expressive, this has flavors of Asian pear, orange, lime, vanilla and gooseberry. Bright and zesty, this would make for a fine apéritif, and it would also pair well with Asian fare.",90,16,California,Sonoma Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
"If you're used to soft, ripe Napa Valley Cabernet, this one, grown just over the Lake County border, will strike you as dry and unyielding. The tannins are pronounced, giving it a hard bite. But it's rich and deep in crème de cassis, the sort of wine that seems ageworthy. Take a gamble and put it in your cellar for 6–8 years.",90,28,California,Red Hills Lake County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare.",90,19,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"This Cabernet has rich blackberry-jam and black licorice flavors, and it also has a funky bacon note. The oak provides a pleasant backdrop of sweet toast. This shows how well Cabernet can perform on the far Sonoma Coast, which is now more oriented to Pinot Noir.",90,20,California,Sonoma Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This elegant and detailed Pinot Gris offers fresh floral accents around spicy, toasty, well-mixed fruit. Pear and orange fruit flavors carry just a slight hint of honey, and the concentrated finish extends into a long, clean fade-out.",90,17,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Gris
"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold.",90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"The fruit shines here—pears and apples aplenty—with textural notes of citrus rind. Balanced, with medium length, it's a young, clean, lip-smacking style, with more density than most Oregon Pinot Gris.",90,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Just released after nearly eight years, this wine still tastes lively and timely. It's marked by complex waves of blackberries, mocha, currants, cola and spices, although the fruit is beginning to move into drier, secondary characteristics. It's delicious, and fully ready to drink now. Give it a decanting, and watch as it changes in the glass.",90,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's no oak on this delightfully dry wine, although you'd never know it from the rich streak of vanilla and smoky butter that accompanies the orange, apricot, lime and honey flavors. It's a brilliant success, bright and zesty in acidity, and one of the most satisfying Pinot Gris on the market.",90,17,California,Edna Valley,Pinot Gris
"A voluptuous wine packed with almonds, a handful of herbs and citrus aromas and flavors, this big-boned, dry, barrel-fermented Roussanne finishes with a swirl of lemon. Available in 2013.",90,25,California,Sierra Foothills,Roussanne
"Fruit is the star of this crisp wine. It bursts with pineapples, tangerines, limes and honeysuckle flowers, with a savory touch of vanilla and buttered toast. Best of all is the brisk acidity that highlights the richness.",90,17,California,Sonoma County,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"A somewhat pale wine, at first reluctant to show much aroma, it ultimately reveals itself to be elegant and surprisingly deep. Varietally expressive, with light cranberry and strawberry fruit, dusty tannins, toast, caramel and a whiff of incense. Complex and lovely.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"A beautiful, bargain-priced blend of Tinta Roriz (aka Tempranillo), Touriga Nacional, Touriga Francesa and Alvarelhão. Violet and jasmine perfumed, this wine is so, so pretty with just a stunning nose. In taste, there's raspberry, strawberry and lilting layers of pepper and herbs. An intriguing wine well worth trying, made by Morgan Winery Winegrower Dan Lee.",90,16,California,Alta Mesa,Tempranillo Blend
"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity.",94,18,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"The Helix Chardonnay is a lush offering of pineapple flavor, plus a leesy, mineral-soaked midpalate that is supremely refreshing. It has terrific acidity and persistence on the palate.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This pure Merlot is made from fruit that was sourced from Bacchus, Conner Lee, Dionysus and Klipsun vineyards. Sappy, spicy and loaded with black fruits, this delivers plenty of flavor across the rich midpalate. Notes of black cherries, coffee grounds, licorice and smoke all come into play.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"While this Chardonnay has rich tropical fruit and citrus flavors, with a light touch of oak, the acidity and minerality make it taste clean and balanced. Don't drink it too cold, and be sure to enjoy it with Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread.",90,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Bone dry and hinting at a sweet herb flavor, this wine backs away from the fruitiness found in most domestic Chenin Blanc. It offers complex details of yellow fruit, lemon verbena and beeswax.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chenin Blanc
"Here's a big, ripe and dry Cabernet with flavors of blackberry, molasses and dark chocolate that seem almost overripe due to a touch of raisin. Tannic and full bodied, it's too robust to drink now, so give it 6–8 years in a cellar.",90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A structured, mountain-grown Grenache, with 20% Syrah in the mix, this features cherry cola, black tea and meat flavors, plus oak tones and docile tannins. It's ready to drink, but it's built to age for another 3–5 years.",90,25,California,Amador County,Grenache
"Off-dry, this succulent wine has you smacking your lips rather than puckering them. The natural acidity buoys up the sweet fruit, a mix of peach and apricot principally, and the wine has an excellent focused core that trails off into suggestions of honeycomb and lemon custard.",90,18,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Riesling
"This is a full-bodied wine that belies the notion that Oregon always makes a sleeker style of Chardonnay. Here are ripe, round flavors of peach and mango, wrapped in naturally vivid acidity, with a warming sensation in the finish. Best enjoyed soon, while fresh and young.",90,27,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Chardonnay
"Shows the fantastic power and extracted fruit that this vineyard is famous for. Just massive in apricots, tangerines and pears, it's enriched with sweet smoky oak, which adds vanilla bean and buttered toast to the richness. Fortunately, brisk acidity and minerality provide balance.",90,23,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"It's classic Alexander Valley, soft, rich and thick in melted tannins, and elaborate in tiers of briary wild berries, milk chocolate, black pepper and sweet charred oak. Easy to drink with everything from burgers and steaks to tacos and teriaki beef.",90,19,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"A precise, detailed and thoroughly exemplary Viognier. It's both thick and racy, loaded with ripe, rich tree fruits, with lemon drop citrus and a lick of lightly honeyed butterscotch. Luscious and lingering.",93,24,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"This is a lovely Pinot Noir, with a translucent ruby color. It's dry, delicately structured, moderate in alcohol and complex. The cherry, pomegranate and persimmon flavors have a pleasant tea-like bitterness, along with earthy notes of mushrooms and sweet wild herbs. At this price, it's one of the greatest bargains on the market. Unfortunately, only 800 cases are in circulation.",93,25,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir
"Part of a Limited Release series, this supple, oaky Malbec includes Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Made from Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard fruit, this offers compelling blue- and black-fruit flavors that are wrapped in coffee and cream notes. It's a structured wine that can be cellared up to a decade.",90,25,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Malbec
"This is a notable wine for its smooth, supple tannins and its intense flavors of black cherry jam, mocha, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. It's a full-bodied selection for drinking soon, and be sure to pair it with almost anything involving cured meat.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"This wine captures the essence of Swan's 2010 Pinot Noirs. It shows the effects of the cool vintage, and it bears an earthy, mushroomy inflection to the plummy and cherry-like flavors.",90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"One of the best Californian Pinot Gris currently available, this is rich, creamy and complex, and it would make for a great alternative to Chardonnay. This wine traditionally ages in used oak, which imparts just a hint of wood-driven sweetness to the pear, peach, mango and lime flavors.",90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Gris
"This tastes bone dry, with cleansing acidity and firm minerality. It offers subtle layers of green apples, figs and tropical fruits, plus an edge of sweet vanilla.",90,20,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay
"The inclusion of 11% Aligoté, which was sourced from a block planted in 1979, makes this Chardonnay unique. The Aligoté seems to thicken the core fruit, and it adds flesh and rind-like flavor, along with old-vine details of dried herb and spice. It's a pleasing mix of integrated stone-fruit, grain and citrus-peel notes.",90,22,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Chardonnay
"Made from fruit that was sourced from Olsen Vineyards, this Syrah's blackberry, cherry and pepper flavors and fine-grained tannins combine to make a wine with good length and a clean finish.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"This shows classic Cabernet Sauvignon character, and there's even a Bordeaux-like earthiness that grounds the cherry, currant and cedar flavors. Made from fruit grown in the winery's Alexander Valley vineyard, this is ideal for drinking now.",90,20,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Zinfandel's tannins are starting to resolve, which gives the palate a soft, melted quality. The primary flavors are transforming into rich, dried black-raspberry and cherry notes, with leather, mocha, dried mushroom and spice accents.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"Soft, fruity and spicy, this Zinfandel is starting to pick up some bottle-age notes. The currant and black raspberry flavors are joined by sautéed mushroom and charred bone accents. The rich tannins suggest pairing it with roasted or barbecued meats.",90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
"California rosé is awfully hard to get right. It's usually too sweet, too heavy or both. With this Grenache-Cinsault blend, Minassian-Young knocks it out of the park. The wine is dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, and complex, with subtle peach, rosehip tea, orange zest, watermelon and spice flavors. A great bargain, but only 64 cases were produced.",92,16,California,Paso Robles,Rosé
"The blend of these four Rhône white grapes—47% Grenache Blanc, 32% Marsanne, 16% Roussanne, 5% Picpoul—outshines their individual bottlings. Some sort of magic accrues. The Sirocco is supple, creamy and packed with aromas and flavors of citrus blossom, flesh and rind. It's got a peaches-and-cream mouthfeel, and a lick of butterscotch in the lush finish.",92,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Rhône-style White Blend
"This is high in alcohol, but it will easily pair with barbecue. It's made from fruit grown in the warm Larner Vineyard in Santa Ynez Valley as well as from the cool Lafond Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. Rich, dry and complex, it offers brisk, citrusy acidity to offset the ripe blackberry, currant and sandalwood flavors.",90,28,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah
"This is clean and brisk in lemony acidity, and it offers concentrated, complex flavors of honeyed pineapples, limes, oranges and mangoes. It's dry and finessed.",90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"Made from fruit that was sourced from this excellent vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, this Cabernet is dense and muscular, and it bears deep berry and cassis flavors at its core. The polished tannins are wreathed in a whiff of smoke and streaked with accents of anise and herb. This is a wine to cellar for another 5–10 years.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Always extremely popular, this Southern Rhône-style six-grape blend is especially noteworthy in 2011. It's a powerful wine that has a broad array of red and purple fruits, plus penetrating focus. This is juicy, forward and immediately delicious, and it also has the structure to age, perhaps surprisingly well.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Rhône-style Red Blend
"Threads of licorice, steel, earth and smoke weave through the proportionate strawberry and raspberry flavors, offset by hints of herb and baking spice. It's a seamless, complex wine of moderate length.",90,27,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"Rich and full-bodied, this has the weight of a barrel-fermented, lees-aged wine. This 100% Pinot Blanc has plenty of orange, cream, brown sugar and brown butter flavors. Try it as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay.",90,21,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Blanc
"This splendid effort is sourced from the Durant Vineyard, and aged in neutral French oak for seven months prior to bottling. Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove. The 20-year-old vines provide the complexity and detail that will reward another decade of aging. Drink now through 2025.",94,29,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
"This white blend is two thirds Sémillon, one third Sauvignon Blanc. It has continued to improve from vintage to vintage, and this is the best yet. A Washington take on Bordeaux blanc, it's dry and fresh, with golden apple and sweet grain extending across the palate and on through a lingering, lightly peachy finish.",92,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style White Blend
"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary. That extra bit of aging has mellowed the wine, giving it a creamy, buttery richness. It has good acidity, too, that gives a lift to the ripe tropical fruits.",92,26,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
"This is one of the best rosés on the market. With a pretty orange and copper color, the wine is dry, crisp and deeply flavored in fruits, yet feels delicate and subtle. The blend is Mourvèdre, Syrah and Grenache.",92,20,California,Paso Robles,Rosé
"Unique in style and sourced—these are the oldest Pinot Gris vines in the country—this young, yeasty, textural wine will surely continue to improve in the bottle. Give it a lot of breathing time, and complex layers of rock and fruit unfold. Jicama, cucumber, daikon radish...You get the idea. It tastes as clean and fresh as a mountain spring.",92,22,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Gris
"Spicy, with a big red-fruit expression, this is a yummy Barbera that's full of bright cherry juice. It's textured, layered and complex with a leathery finish. This wine is one to store for future enjoyment or to break open now with pasta now.",92,25,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Barbera
"An exceptionally good Pinot, from a winery that frequently gets overlooked, perhaps because they're not charging an arm and a leg. The wine is light and silky in the mouth, with alcohol well under 14%, and marked with crisp acidity and fine-grained tannins. The flavors are classic pomegranates, rhubarbs and black cherries. Should develop over the next 4–6 years. What a great value.",92,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"This is an aromatic, honeysuckle-tinged cool-climate white, with layers of honey and spice. Light in body and texture, this complex, Alsace-style effort is the perfect accompaniment to Thai, Indian, Korean barbecue or spicy Chinese food.",90,20,California,Anderson Valley,Gewürztraminer
"A fine vintage of Bill Easton's Cabernet Franc, from the Monarch Mine Vineyard, where he typically sources tremendous Syrah and Barbera, this wine is still developing and will do nicely with time. For now it shows perfumed herbal restraint, subtle spice and a twist of oaky coffee on the finish. A savory wine that would pair well with filet mignon à point.",92,20,California,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc
"Longoria brings a deft touch to this Pinot Grigio. The grapes were briefly fermented in tank, then bottled when the wine was only about four months old. The result is exceptionally fresh and lively, with tangy acidity brightening citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and white pepper flavors.",91,19,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Grigio
"This is a lovely wine, with flavors both rich and racy—cool minerality meets ripe lemon/lime, with a dollop of creamy custard. It's mouthfilling and smooth, with lingering, delicious flavors that resonate beautifully.",93,29,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
"This is a cool-climate Chardonnay that's dark gold in color and tastes of ripe apple. From both the Ferrington and Savoy Vineyards, two of Anderson Valley's finest, it shows the greatness of the vintage in coastal Mendocino. Fragrant and rich in honey and toasty notes, it finishes crisp. Crab cakes with it would be ideal.",91,28,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay
"Sadly, this is the last vintage for this Klipsun vineyard-sourced Sauvignon Blanc. It's a fine send-off, a buttery, caramel-soaked take on the grape, with rich fruit flavors of Meyer lemon and light tropical. A deep and damaging freeze cut the crop by more than 80%, and the vines have been pulled.",91,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"With 20% Petite Sirah blended in, Andis's Barbera is juicy, balanced and perfumey. It's a beautiful wine with cranberry, vanilla and cherry aromas and flavors. Pair with your favorite pasta, pizza or grilled meats.",91,28,California,Amador County,Barbera
"Juicy and dark with layers of boysenberry and blackberry fruit, with high tones of tar and brick, Cedarville's estate-grown Zin comes to life in decomposed granite soils, giving the wine a satisfying and sultry profile. Enjoy this Zin in good time (3–5 years) and pair with dark, smoky meats.",91,22,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
"Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts. Shellfish, light seafood, poultry and even pork dishes would be fine matches.",91,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"This is an elegant Syrah, blended with 18% Mourvèdre and topped with a splash of Grenache. Good phenolic ripeness along with substantial sugars lead into flavors that have melded nicely. Berry, truffle, chocolate, leather, pepper and coffee are all in the mix, and the mid-palate is delicious. Only a fairly quick fade keeps the score from climbing even higher.",91,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"All six Bordeaux grapes make an appearance in this well-oaked spicebox of a red. It's just plain delicious, from the first sniff on through. The firm mid-palate shows pretty blue, purple and black fruits, a touch of black olive, black tea, and those oh-so-tasty baking spices.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Even by Dunham's high standards, this is a spectacular Riesling. A little spritz to give it a turbo start, a textural and focused entry, a broad splash of spicy apple, pear, apricot and light tropical fruit, and then a surprising streak of honeyed almonds. This wine just rocks.",94,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Peach pit, apple and pear fruit flavors combine in this crisp, somewhat steely wine that has a classic elegance. Depth, length and finishing minerality make this a wine worth extra attention.",92,25,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
"Lovely tree fruits and a hint of honeycomb come through in this well-balanced Pinot Gris. It offers both easy drinkability and surprising depth of flavor, with a lingering finish that should cost you significantly more.",91,12,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"An interesting wine that's far more subtle than the price suggests. Blended from Roussanne and Grenache Blanc, it displays a complex balance of fresh fruits, herbs, cashews, smoked meats and vanilla, while remaining lively in acidity and fundamentally dry. Easily the best white wine yet from Minassian-Young.",91,16,California,Paso Robles,Roussanne-Grenache Blanc
"A pure Petite Sirah from 36-year-old vines grown in decomposed granite soil, this Cedarville bottling is appropriately purple-black in color, and rich with milk chocolate and licorice flavor. It's soft with juicy tannins, and boasts a long, luxurious finish. It'll sit quietly in the cellar for 10–15 years, if not longer, a commanding study in the evolved beauty of Petite Sirah.",90,27,California,El Dorado,Petite Sirah
"Easton's small-production Barbera is tight, showcasing its mountain-grown fruit, and quite savory and leathery in style. With a backbone of blacker fruit than Cooper Ranch, it's earthy and ready for mushroom-laden pasta dishes or risotto.",90,25,California,Sierra Foothills,Barbera
"Fragrant with peach aromas and wet-stone minerality, this dry Riesling is well integrated, smooth and refreshing. It is delicious on its own as an apéritif or will make a mellow partner to all manner of appetizers, especially those with seafood and a twist of heat or chili spice.",90,22,California,Mendocino,Riesling
"There is some alchemy at work here, for this unusual Dolcetto—all 24 cases of it—has the complexity of blended wines. Tart pomegranate fruit, streaks of stem and cement, mint and spice, all rise briefly and then fall away. It's a detailed wine, in the enigmatic style that marks this tiny winery as sui generis. Among the lineup of reds from 2010, it's best of show at the moment.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Dolcetto
"Clean, vibrant in acidity and ripe in fruit, with lemon and lime flavors accented with a hit of green gooseberries. The finish is totally dry and stimulating. The cool 2012 vintage has given this wine elegance, making it a another value after the 2010 and 2011.",90,20,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
"An eminently drinkable blend of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc, this shows a delicate honey aroma on the nose, along with apricot-filled brioche and sweetly cooked chanterelle mushrooms. It's very light and restrained on the palate. Nectarine flesh, yellow peaches and dried mango gain structure and depth from a lime peel tartness and chalky minerality.",92,28,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style White Blend
"This dry Moscato Giallo from Lodi is delicious, with an intensely perfumed nose that follows through in the taste, alongside Meyer lemon, jasmine and cantaloupe. Very unusual, incredibly well priced and modest in alcohol, this lush, ginger-tinged Moscato is this taster's desert-island white.",94,16,California,Lodi,Moscato Giallo
"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.",93,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Anyone intrigued by the array of alternative whites being produced in California right now should know about this wine, an incredibly priced, low-alcohol sipper that's also complex enough to pair with a range of lighter foods. Its aromas of apricot and sweet peach are most inviting, and the wine also has a saltiness layered around its acidity that hits in the midpalate and then finishes dry. A complex, medium-bodied, layered white that tastes of the sea.",93,14,California,Lodi,Vermentino
"This standout wine has enticing herb and mineral aromas, plus rich, unorthodox flavors that resemble fresh fennel bulb and crisp white peach along with racy acidity and a good, substantial mouthfeel. It tastes concentrated, though not overly full bodied, but most of all it has a memorable personality.",92,18,California,Sierra Foothills,Sauvignon Blanc
"A wonderful array of aromas wafts up from the glass, resembling pencil shavings (a good thing!), cigar box, touch of earthiness and cherry compote. The mouthfeel is luxurious; layered flavors of black currant, black cherry, chocolate and clove stay lively through the long finish. It drinks well now, but will improve through at least 2019.",92,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fermented in stainless steel and one neutral barrel, this aromatic and compelling wine is clean, fresh and full of delicious fruit. Meyer lemon, satsuma orange and fresh pineapple are in the mix, with supporting acidity. Tasted a full day after being opened, it remained vivid and expressive.",92,20,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is an unusual blend of Grenache and Pinot Noir, which are not often combined, neither in California nor in France. The winemaker is Jess Pisoni, and he has crafted a highly likeable blush. Pale in color and delicate in the mouth, it has ever-so-slightly lush flavors of orange tea, peaches and vanilla. The acidity is wonderful.",90,15,California,Central Coast,Rosé
"Fields Family shows its versatility with this wine, excelling at not only Syrah and Zinfandel but Tempranillo, too, all grown and produced in Lodi. This one has plenty of smooth, silky mouthfeel amid layers of bright red fruit and smoky vanilla.",90,22,California,Lodi,Tempranillo
"This is a very good price for a Zinfandel this fine. It's fairly delicate in mouthfeel for a Zin, with a light silkiness, and the tannin-acid architecture is elegant. As for the actual flavors, they're intense in red fruits, currants, sweet licorice and pepper. Hard to imagine a better wine for drinking over the next few years with barbecue.",90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"Over the years, Longoria has proven itself to be one of the best producers of Albariño in California. The 2012 bottling doesn't disappoint. In its dryness, crisp acidity, sleek flavors and modest alcohol level, it defines the grape variety's possibilities in the Golden State. The wine never saw oak. What you get are savory lemongrass and grapefruit flavors, with hints of honey and nectarines.",90,23,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Albariño
"Great price for a blush wine this sophisticated. Lynmar manages to tame Syrah's power and exuberance into elegant sleekness, resulting in a dry, tart wine with vibrant raspberry, orange zest and vanilla richness.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Rosé
"No one in Washington makes better Semillon at this price. Dry and subtle, it benefits from blending with 10% Sauvignon Blanc, showing bright citrus rind, light toast, and excellent length.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",93,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Named after the federally designated Wild & Scenic River that flows through the property, this blend shows red currant cake, black cherries, licorice, slate and cedar on the delicious nose. The palate is very spicy and tasty, driven by cinnamon, dried strawberries and a powerful amount of intriguing spice.",92,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Red Blend
"A tasty array of delicious fruit flavors merges with meaty, savory, smoky nuances in this full-bodied, bold-tasting and very enjoyable wine. It smells like blackberries, blueberries and oak smoke, and tastes more wild and beefy until a wave of fruit envelops the finish. It shows interesting complexity along with lip-smacking allure.",92,24,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),G-S-M
"This has a very deep, dark color that goes almost to the rim. It smells like blackberries and black pepper, tastes exotic and almost full-bodied but stays quite dry. It gives the sense of being well-stuffed with flavor but keeps a rather lean, lighter texture. Firm tannins give it structure and suggest drinking now through 2019.",92,26,California,Sierra Foothills,Syrah
"For the price, you get a Cabernet that shows some pretty good Napa character. It's ripe and forward with black currants with tough tannins and a hit of sweet oak. Lots going on, and could even age for a few years. If you drink it now, give it a couple hours of airing.",90,22,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Wente remains remarkably adept at making very good wines in big volumes at fair prices. This is a textbook example—a crisp, layered and complex SB that's as floral as spring, generous in acidity and lemony on the finish. Pair with shellfish, chicken or goat cheese on crackers.",90,15,California,Livermore Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Distinctive aromas of beeswax and bee pollen continue with similar flavors, wrapped around tart yellow apple fruit. It's lovely, fragrant and ageworthy, in a high-acid Euro mold, but give it plenty of time to breathe. Decanting is a good idea.",90,17,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Blanc
"Very good price for a nice, silky, dry Pinot of this quality. It's quite restrained, in keeping with the vintage, showing herb-inflected sour cherry candy, cranberry, red currant and spice flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",90,24,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir
"Smoky and teeth staining with savory blackberry fruit, this Petite is balanced, with a long finish, and will get better with 3–7 years of bottling age. Think grilled meats when pairing.",90,28,California,Lodi,Petite Sirah
"One of the fuller-bodied Albariños out there, this bottling, from veteran winemaker Volk, is dense in cream, tangerine, Meyer lemon, hazelnut and spice flavors. It's a complex wine that changes in interesting ways as it warms up in the glass.",90,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Albariño
"Deliciously poised between sweet and tart, much the way good Vouvray walks the same line, this single-vineyard Riesling offers deep flavors of Meyer lemon, English breakfast tea, and tangy stone fruits. Full-bodied and lingering.",92,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Riesling
"A blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Syrah and 16% Merlot, the 2008 Trutina has elevated itself beyond any previous vintage. Firm, chewy, tight and spicy, it's a fully integrated and complex wine. Cassis, earth, lead pencil, coffee grounds and a streak of iron keep the flavors piling on. This bottle tastes way more expensive than it actually is.",92,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Stainless-steel fermented from 100-percent Lodi-grown Moscato Giallo grapes, Uvaggio's yearly dry Moscato is always a good value and great tasting. This one is layered with spice, but it's also very floral with a gentle imprint and a taste of ginger and lime.",90,14,California,Lodi,Moscato Giallo
"Well-aged and drinking at a peak, this 100% Sangiovese is round and toasty, filled with plush cherry fruit, and just a smidgen of green olive. The barrel aging brings in accents of toasted walnuts through a full, inviting finish.",90,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese
"Wonderfully fragrant and pretty, this delicately-made Riesling mixes candied pineapple, honeyed lemon, and pekoe tea flavors to good effect. It's a perfect late spring porch pounder.",90,12,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"A solid Amador County Primitivo from a consistently good producer that is subtle with bright red and blue fruit with a layer of mint and earthy cedar. Well crafted, it tastes light and soft from start to finish.",90,24,California,Amador County,Primitivo
"With this bottling, Kenneth Volk has produced the quintessential cool-climate, unoaked Chardonnay. The grape variety reveals itself strongly, with classic peach and tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe, almost apricoty. The Santa Maria Valley's chilly climate shows up in brisk, mouthwatering acidity, while the finish is thoroughly dry. Additional richness was provided by sur-lie aging, which brings creamy notes.",90,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"The new release from this old (1972) vineyard boosts the alcohol to 13.9%, dropping the residual sugar to just over 1%. Deep, concentrated, and driven by a dense minerality, this exceptional single-vineyard Riesling has raw fruit flavors of green apple, white peach and citrus rind. Sure to evolve, perhaps over decades, it has the vivid acidity and penetrating finish to improve significantly.",93,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
"Amazing that a winery would hold back an estate-grown Syrah for five years before release, but Joseph Swan did with this wine. It's still pretty tannic, but the core of blackberries, blueberries and dark chocolate is starting to explode into the secondary characteristics associated with aged wine. And that is very exciting, especially at this price. Should continue to evolve over the next five years.",92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"Few Syrahs get this ripe, even in California. The wine explodes in blackberry and plum jam fruit flavors, with intricate layers of grilled meat, cola, licorice, black pepper, clove and cinnamon spice. The tannins are thick, smooth and delightful in the mouth, giving the wine a firm, balanced structure. Best through 2014, before the fruit starts to fade.",92,28,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah
"Another lovely Julia's Pinot from Cambria, at a fair price. With its light tannins and transparency, it's definitely Pinot Noir, and the acidity testifies to a cool climate. You might even pick out the Santa Maria Valley from the crushed Indian spices. Subtle but intriguing cherry, cola and plum flavors round out the picture. Drink now–2015.",92,25,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high. You can drink this instead of a red wine with lighter meats, such as lamb or pork.",90,25,California,Russian River Valley,Rosé
"La Folia continues to impress with this young bottling of Dolcetto, its light body and texture tinged with a taste of savory mint, licorice and earth balanced against layers of sweet strawberry. Enjoy throughout spring and summer with antipasto",90,28,California,Sierra Foothills,Dolcetto
"A welcome addition to the Bunchgrass lineup, this white Bordeaux-style blend is one third barrel-fermented Semillon, two thirds tank-fermented Sauvignon Blanc. The ripe and textural fruit still shows a lightly yeasty character, along with highlights of honey graham cracker.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style White Blend
"With a dollop of Carignane, also from old vines grown organically in Mendocino County, Carol Shelton's Wild Thing ZIn is a fun ride, rich, robust in juicy raspberry fruit, fragrant in vanilla, balanced and approachable. In screwcap, it's a good bottle to grab on the way to a picnic or barbecue.",90,19,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel
"Along with the Carmenère from Reininger, this stylish example belongs in the cellar of anyone with a hunger for this unusual variety. The green olive/herbal nature of the grape is carefully managed, and provides a nuance rather than a dominant flavor. At the core is tart red berry fruit and a wash of dark chocolate.",90,24,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Carmenère
"Fenestra is making a boatload of small-production varieties from Livermore and Lodi, this one from its estate in the Livermore Valley where it's pulled off a stunning version of Mourvèdre, fairly low in alcohol (13.9%) and yet surprising with a black pepper nose, hint of maple, blackberry and baked plum that's drinking great right now.",93,25,California,Livermore Valley,Mourvèdre
"Savory and deep, it carries lovely details of earth and herb, balanced against flavors of lightly spiced apples. As with all the Eyrie wines from this outstanding vintage, it's unique, compelling and utterly original.",93,27,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
"Floral scents greet you at first, a beguiling mix of clover and apple blossom. Pineapple, tangerine and nectarine fruit flavors follow, big and full, finishing with an interesting whiff of almond.",93,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"This is a powerful wine, with intense scents of pineapple leading a lively interplay of citrus, stone, Asian pear and spices. Thrilling texture, balance and length make this a standout, even in this outstanding vintage for all Pinot Gris.",93,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"It would be easy to miss the complexity of this wine, as it comes out of the bottle tight and unyielding. Give it a chance—decant it—and scents of cured meat, game, dried herb and asphalt slowly emerge. The cherry-flavored fruit is there as well, all in proportion, but hidden at first.",92,28,Washington,Lake Chelan,Syrah
"A tremendous value. Hard to believe it's so good, considering the price. The details of its origins and winemaker are mysterious, but it's worth a special search. Rich and dry, it's packed with classic blackberry, black currant, blueberry and cedar flavors, wrapped into firm, smooth tannins. Drink now–2016.",92,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The blend includes a hefty 22% Syrah, but the varietal stamp of the Mourvèdre shines through. Red plum, truffle and smoke are joined by a streak of vanilla. It's attention-getting and distinctive, dense and velvety. A wine to pair with wild game or smoked meats.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Mourvèdre
"This tiny-production, Alsace-style, dry wine combines vivid, spicy flavors with a sophisticated texture and lingering finish. The bold rose-petal and exotic fruit notes melt into a softly balanced mélange that lingers long on the finish. Delicious now through 2018.",92,22,California,Anderson Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Stewed tomatoes, black pepper and pencil shavings kick off this intriguing wine. It then hits the palate with remarkable suavity and ends with a long strawberry finish. In between, the spice rack rules, making this a suitable pairing for Indian curries or other adventurously seasoned cuisine.",92,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"A meaty, gamy Syrah boasting aromas of bacon and duck-liver mousse, this wine delivers tremendous flavor and quality for the price. It offers plenty of body around a core of plush, savory tannins and a long finish of pepper and cinnamon spice. Start slicing the charcuterie.",92,20,California,Sierra Foothills,Syrah
"Almost black in color, the Hovey Petite is layered and concentrated, deep and soulful with flavors of lavender, berry and licorice segued by a coffee and tobacco kicker. A true Petite Sirah lovers' Petite Sirah.",91,22,California,Calaveras County,Petite Sirah
"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), limned with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.",91,19,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"They packed a lot of flavor into this rich Chardonnay for the price. It's toasty buttery and popcorny from winemaker treatment, with ripe fruit notes of pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. A brisk streak of minerals and acidity provides clean balance.",91,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"With appealing pineapple, orange, pear and green apple flavors enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak, this is a delicious Chardonnay. Its bright acidity makes it clean and mouthwatering. It's as good as the winery's more expensive Chards, making it a relative bargain. Production was 4,200 cases.",92,27,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"Angel Vine sources excellent fruit, and makes what is arguably the most hedonistic, California-style Zinfandel in the Northwest. Here blended with 13% Primitivo, the sweet and liquorous berry fruit flavors are deep and luxurious. Buttressed with juicy natural acidity, this wine does not show its 14.8% alcohol.",91,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Zinfandel
"The best of the new releases from Michael Florentino, which has changed hands since this vintage was harvested. Autumnal flavors marry vivid, distinctive fruit to hints of leaf and citrus, elegant and complex.",91,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Mourvèdre
"This release represents a gigantic leap forward for Oberon in their basic Cabernet Sauvignon. Past releases have been so-so. This one's terrific. Blended from vineyards all over the valley, it shows all the hallmarks of a Napa Cab you want. It's dry, full-bodied and impressively ripe in blackberries, currants, licorice and oak, with a long, smooth finish.",91,22,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The label on this impressively balanced, vital and complete Sauvignon Blanc would have been at home on a medieval knight's table. The wine is fresh, concentrated and seamlessly melds bright citrus and lightly herbal aromas into a lively grapefruit and crisp apple character that expands on the palate and lingers on the finish.",92,22,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
"Along with a gorgeous blend of ripe fruits—apple, pear, and a bit of tangy pineapple—this wine carries a streak of wet stone into a full-bodied, lingering finish.",92,17,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Gris
"Newsome-Harlow's largest bottling, the Calaveras County is a delicious deal at $24, steeped in ebullient cherry and raspberry high tones, juicy yet entirely elegant. A classic California Zin in all the best senses, it offers black pepper, muted chocolate and softly layered structure.",92,24,California,Calaveras County,Zinfandel
"Easy to drink, with some sweetness to the pear, apricot and orange flavors, like a drizzle of honey on fresh fruit. The mousse, which creates the mouthfeel, is refined and smooth, lacking sharp edges, which adds to the impression of finesse. Overall, a very fine sparkling wine, especially considering its nonvintage status.",91,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sparkling Blend
"A standout in a recent Chardonnay tasting, the new Lumière is a fulsome, fleshy, bright and concentrated wine, loaded with stone fruits running into light tropical. Rich in the mouth, generous in body and flavor, and finished with naturally juicy acidity.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"The best value among all of Bergevin Lane's 2008 Syrahs, this rich and smoky effort spent 20 months in oak. Sourced from Stone Tree and Francisca's vineyards, it has tight, ripe berry flavors and beautifully manicured tannins.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"A big, ripe, voluptuous Zinfandel, packed with flavor. The deliciousness factor of blackberries, cherries, anise and dark chocolate comes at the cost of high alcohol, which limits the wine's elegance but makes it super-drinkable with the richest barbecue imaginable.",91,26,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"Shows the rich tropical fruit and oak flavors that are so easy to achieve in California. But there's a balancing minerality, like a lick of cold steel, and the acidity is brisk and cleansing. This is a lovely Chardonnay, dry and elegant, and a relative value.",91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Strikes a nice balance between fat, rich, decadently ripe raspberry and date fruit, with a drink-me-now appeal, and a more serious undertow of tannins, mushrooms and pine. Give it a good decant, and focus on what's going on in the glass.",92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"A wonderful, amazingly rewarding wine, certainly one of California's best Albariños. If there's any oak at all, it's insignificant. What stars is brilliant Edna Valley acidity and racy flavors of citrus fruits, pears, white flowers and white peppery spices. The perfect cocktail wine.",92,17,California,Edna Valley,Albariño
"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",92,24,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Chardonnay
"Winemaker Chris Condos appears to have the magic touch when it comes to coaxing great wines out of organic grapes in Mendocino County and this blend of Carignan Petite Sirah, Charbono, Zinfandel and Grenache is pure testament to that, a bargain bottling full of lavender and plum that presents a magical balance between flavor and grip.",91,18,California,Mendocino,Red Blend
"Another successful Tannat from Cambiata, the fourth vintage in a row to score at least 90 points. The grape variety, from southwest France, produces a dry, tannic, full-bodied wine like this one. It has a stringy feel, with deep flavors of raspberries. Will age for a very long time. Interesting as an alternative to a big Zinfandel or Petite Sirah.",91,28,California,Monterey,Tannat
"This is a particularly lovely vintage of the popular Three Legged Red from Dunham. The fruit is a luscious bowl of cherries, with a streak of fresh peach as well. Smooth and supple, it adds gentle barrel notes of light toast, continuing on its elegant path through an extended finish.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Impressive for its depth and deliciousness. The grapes are from Cline's estate on the Sonoma side of the Carneros district. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, although you can drink it now. It's very rich in blackberries, currants, mushu plum sauce, grilled beef and smoky sandalwood, and seems at its best now.",90,20,California,Los Carneros,Syrah
"Solidly packed with ripe black cherry fruit, this well-crafted Syrah ramps up its complexity with a dusty coating of coffee grounds and clean earth. Fine tannins smooth it through a full-bodied finish.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"So soft, silky and sweet in blackberries, cherries and red currants, it could be a big, ripe Pinot Noir. That's a compliment. Petite Sirah can often be overpowering. This one's delicate, elegant and frankly delicious. Best now and over the next four years.",90,27,California,Dry Creek Valley,Petite Sirah
"Plungerhead has sourced Zinfandel from all over the place, but this bottling is their best ever. It defines Dry Creek Valley Zin, being richly tannic and soft, with deep, sweet flavors of wild raspberries, white chocolate, espresso and gingerbread cookie. The alcohol is high, but that's Dry Creek Zin.",90,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths.",91,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"“Gas station” isn't necessarily the most attractive fine-wine descriptor, but it's both apt and complimentary for a dry Riesling. This one reeks of petrol and tar. On the palate, a warm tar presence slowly evolves toward vanilla. A vibrant, tingling acidity indicates decent cellaring potential. At the very least, this is a great wine to show your friends how petrol can be a defining and excellent character in wine.",91,29,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Riesling
"Crisp and distinctive, with a strong mineral streak, this full-flavored Pinot Blanc has a range of fruit flavors, centered upon apple and pear, but also touching on blood orange and a suggestion of celery as well. Low in alcohol, but high in flavor.",91,19,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Blanc
"Classic varietal smells of chalk and golden raisin emerge from this wine. It's lusciously smooth once sipped, with orange, limestone and vanilla pudding leaning up against bitter greens and just-ripe nectarine. Serve with beets and goat cheese or Chinese chicken salad.",91,20,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Riesling
"This leesy and creamy yet bracing wine reveals abundant melon, citrus and pear fruit flavors. Balance and finesse are on full display, as always the case in Luisa Ponzi's wines.",91,17,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Borra demonstrates its mastery with whites in this interesting, perfect mélange of sweetness and zip. Made in a dry style, the sweetness is mostly in the aromatics, which imply peach-colored roses, and inviting mouthfeel, which imparts subtle grapefruit and stone fruit amidst all the crispness.",91,19,California,Lodi,Gewürztraminer
"Spicy and showing some sweetness around the edges, presumably from a bit of residual sugar. Lovely fruit is the highlight here, textural and luscious with flavors of pears and apricots. Vivid acidity cuts through the fleshy core.",91,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Creamy, delicious flavors of pear tart lead this intense, focused, balanced sweet wine. The blend includes Sémillon, Sylvaner and Pinot Gris, from estate vineyards, and the alcohol reaches 12.5%—fairly high for a dessert wine, but indicative of the overall concentration and ripeness.",91,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,White Blend
"Rounded out nicely (in contrast to the searingly tart 2008), this revels in stone fruits, pineapple, mixed citrus and racy acidity. It's a juicy, penetrating wine, vividly expressive and utterly refreshing.",91,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"The trick with Vognier is to take its exotic fruit and contain it with acidity and dryness. Swan's '09 accomplishes that task. It's big in tropical fruit and orange flavors, but crisp and minerally, and the finish turns dry and clean. A beautiful restaurant Viognier.",91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Viognier
"Run, don't walk, to get this Cab at this price. It's very rich and delicious, offering waves of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, chocolate, smoky oak and spices. Feels round and supple and soft in the mouth, making it fine for drinking now. Production was 4,400 cases.",91,20,California,Napa-Sonoma-Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Anyone making Grenache Blanc in California should be encouraged, Terre Rouge's version being a delightfully drinkable mix of apple and peach with a rich, full mouth that finishes crisp. Grown at high elevation (2,200 feet) on the Hawk Creek Vineyard in Sierra Foothills, a small production worth seeking out. And it's only 13% alcohol.",91,20,California,Sierra Foothills,Grenache Blanc
"Bergevin Lane's Calico White never fails to please. The 2010 is one-third Chardonnay, the rest a mix of Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne. Dry and silky, with subtle stone fruit flavors and authoritative grip, this nicely balanced wine has exceptional length for its modest price.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend
"A solid Petite Sirah. You can use it in a wine education class as a textbook example of the variety. It's full bodied, tannic and rich in blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis, cola, grilled meat and black pepper flavors, enhanced by oak. Should age effortlessly, without gaining complexity, for many years.",90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Petite Sirah
"If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you. It's an explosion of tangerines, golden mangoes, peaches and pears, with buttery, creamy overtones and a finish of honey. Lots of zesty acidity adds a balancing scour to the mouthfeel.",90,28,California,Napa Valley,Viognier
"A blend of Tempranillo, Grenache and Syrah, this toasty, supple, seductive wine has a Zin-like focus of pure raspberry fruit. Elegant and stylish, with sculpted tannins and a hint of herb.",90,20,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Red Blend
"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Sparkling Blend
"A very easy-drinking white Rhône blend of 44% Marsanne, 29% Viognier and 27% Roussanne that highlights each in its own right, the perfume and body of the Marsanne balanced deftly with Roussanne's more delicate, pear-like features and the honeysuckle, orange essence aromatics of the Viognier shining through and yet not overpowering.",91,25,California,Sierra Foothills,Rhône-style White Blend
"The definitive Dry Creek Zinfandel. It has tons of spices, wild berries and cherries and sweetly smoked sandalwood. Handles its high alcohol well, with the heat accenting the peppers. A lusty, complex Zin to drink now.",91,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Tuck this puppy into the cellar for a long time, at least six years. The tannins are fierce, a drone attack on the palate that numbs it flat. But it's very rich and sweet in raspberry essence, with good Russian River acidity. An interesting California expression of this grape variety.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Tannat
"This is a preview of Swan's vineyard-designated '09s yet to come, and it sure is exciting. It's a beautiful, sensual wine, rich in acidity and delicious in raspberries and cherries. Near perfect for drinking now.",90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"A beautiful Gewürztraminer showing classic spice, honeysuckle and tropical fruit flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Great to drink now with spicy fusion fare. Only 151 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",90,19,California,Russian River Valley,Gewürztraminer
"A perfect summer blush wine. Made in the style of the southern Rhône, it's rich in strawberry, raspberry, rosehip tea, vanilla and spice flavors, brightened with zesty acidity. Just delicious with smoked meats, tempura, ahi tuna tartare.",90,21,California,Napa Valley,Rosé
"The name comes from the Josephine/Mariposa Complex soils, gravelly loam vineyard underlain with crumbly yellow slate. This is a finely tuned blend of 72% Grenache Noir and 28% Mourvèdre. The aromas are heady in rhubarb compote and wild raspberry with a candied, perfumed character. In taste, it's more bright red fruit with an underlayer of herb and stony minerality. Medium in body, the wine delivers substantial length and depth.",91,26,California,Sierra Foothills,Rhône-style Red Blend
"Taking off with a bright tangerine and lime nose, the citrus carries through to the palate, where grapefruit flavors take the varietal into curious yet compelling places. Acidity is at the forefront, thanks to the all-stainless-steel processing, but it feels strategically integrated.",91,20,California,Santa Barbara,Chardonnay
"Winemaker Michael McCay considers this white a field blend, listing Vermentino, Verdelho, Muscat and an improbable dollop of Pinot Noir as the varieties. Together they equate to deliciousness, a light, stainless-fermented statement of pineapple and guava, the Vermentino's salty head rearing just slightly.",91,24,California,Lodi,White Blend
"Uvaggio is making a serious case for Lodi Vermentino. This bottling is compelling: savory with herb and green olive notes, and yet freshly fruity and delicate, well integrated and plenty acidic to stand up to a wide range of food, even given its modest 11% alcohol level. A stunner that'll keep you thinking, and asking for more.",93,14,California,Lodi,Vermentino
"You get a lot of pleasure from this affordable Cab. It's dry, moderate in alcohol which gives it a light mouthfeel, and quite pleasant in classic flavors of blackberries, currants and herbs, touched with smoky oak. Elegantly constructed, it's one of the best Cabernets of the vintage at this price.",90,12,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Yes this is a big boy but its chocolate and espresso mixed with dark caramel are so well defined, so bold that anyone looking for a serious example of mountain Primitivo need look no farther. The wine's cherry flavors are vibrantly balanced between an intensity of layered darkness and complexity.",90,24,California,Amador County,Primitivo
"Zaca Mesa accomplishes the difficult task of creating a ripe, fruity rosé that finishes thoroughly dry. This is a minor miracle in California. It's all Grenache, which accounts for the cherry flavors, but there's a bracing minerality and fine, clean acidity.",90,16,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Rosé
"Good price for a Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir this good. Shows lots of zippy acidity and is very dry, with complex layers of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola and dusty spices. Drink now.",90,24,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir
"A big, lusty Zin, with a blast of briary raspberry, cherry, cocoa, beef jerky, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors. No mere fruit bomb, it's framed with a fine acid-tannin structure, and finishes dry. Best now and over the next six years, before the fruit starts fading.",90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"A very nice Zin, lusty and rich, with ripe flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, smoked meat and dusty baking spices. It's a big wine whose fruits and tannins suggest pairing with smoky barbecue.",90,28,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
"Elegance marks this wine, grown on the cool-climate Laetitia estate, so close to the Pacific along the Central Coast. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a minerally tow to the pineapple and lime flavors. Oak is evident, but the underlying wine is the star.",90,18,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Pinot Blanc
"There's no oak on this wine, which lets the fruit star. It does a bravura performance, with turns of pineapples, limes, gooseberries and tart mandarin oranges that finish in a swirl of spices. Acidity adds a brilliant zestiness, and even though the alcohol is only 12.9% by volume, the wine is thoroughly dry.",90,19,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
"Distinctive aromatic qualities mark this afforable bottling, an exclusive for Hawaiian supermarket chain Foodland from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton. The aromas recall chaparral scrub, mint tea and black sage. The herbaceousness continues on the palate, with a sticky tannic structure. Not exactly the wine for those seeking a red fruit experience, but good for those seeking the savory side of the grape.",91,23,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir
"A beautiful bottling that will prosper with time, easily until 2024, this grippy, earthy Zin offers soft plum and brambly blackberry amid a pretty, floral nose and plenty of peppery anise and earth. Aged in French oak from low-yielding vines originally planted in 1865, this is a premier example of Fiddletown Zin made with precision and care.",91,28,California,Fiddletown,Zinfandel
"Fans of Sancerre will love this complex, lean and lively Sauvignon. The color is a light straw-yellow and aromas recall grapefruit and lime. Flavors of bright, tangy citrus continue on the palate, with a note of white pepper. The snappy balance and lithe texture keeps everything echoing on the finish.",91,17,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
"From a 2,500-foot elevation site, this Cab Franc is intriguingly peppery, light in oak and resplendent in raspberry liqueur aromas and a trace of pine forest. Moderate in tannins and silky in texture it's ready to be enjoyed now with cheese and charcuterie.",91,24,California,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc
"Pinot Blanc in a warm year such as 2012 veers closer to the fruitiness of Pinot Gris, as shown here. Barrel fermented in French oak, it remains sleek and crisply defined, with pure fruit flavors of golden apple and ripe pear.",91,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"Rich but lively and dry, this wine packs a potpourri of spices and citrus fruits in its aromas and flavors, carrying them through to a lingering finish. Substantial and appetizing as an apéritif and excellent with seafood.",91,20,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Gris
"From the excellent Stonetree vineyard, just two barrels were made. Seductive, ripe and jammy blueberry and blackberry fruit soaks the tongue, set against firm but well-balanced tannins. The fruit is spectacular, and the wine takes its high alcohol in stride.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Petite Sirah
"Delicious is the word that comes to mind drinking this Pinot Noir. It's young and vibrant in acidity, with waves of raspberries, persimmons, honey, cinnamon, cloves and smoky sandalwood. Good over the next five years.",90,29,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"Here's a big, rich, fruity Cabernet that satisfies for its array of blackberry, cherry, currant, mineral and oak flavors. It's dry and tannic, and the overall quality is quite high. The price makes it a good Buy. Drink through 2014",90,22,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's some barrel influence in this Chardonnay, but the oak is way in the background. What stars is Edna Valley fruit, pure and refined and textbook varietal. Pineapples, tangerines, Meyer lemons, limes, kiwis, you get the idea— clean, acidic, mouthwatering citrus fruits—brilliantly crisp and tangy. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",90,28,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"Adelsheim helped to pioneer Dijon clone Chardonnay in Oregon, a movement that completely reshaped and reinvigorated those wines. Crisp styling (from stainless steel fermentation and no malolactic) puts the emphasis on clean, refreshing fruit flavors of melon, star fruit, lime and cucumber, with excellent concentration and length.",90,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"At nearly five years of age, this wine tastes like it was just bottled. It's still juicy and fresh in raspberries, cherries and spices, with a sweet, clean finish. A pretty, polished and complex wine to drink now and over the next 6–8 years.",90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"Winemaking team Alex MacGregor and David Ramey have produced a beautiful Sauvignon Blanc here, from organically farmed grapes grown in several vineyards throughout Mendocino County, including owner John Fetzer's Kathleen's Vineyard, named for his mom. Barrel-fermented but having not undergone ML, the wine is deliciously fresh and vibrant with lots of minerality to recommend, as well as depth.",90,23,California,Mendocino County,Sauvignon Blanc
"Tart and tight, with primary raspberry and cranberry fruit, dotted with licorice, cola and cinnamon notes. Despite its youth, it shows appealing complexity, leading into a full and satisfying finish with drying tannins. Give it a couple more years of bottle age and you will have a real winner on your hands.",90,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"Though lightly ripened, with alcohol at 13.5% and flavors keeping to the yellow-green fruit spectrum, the use of oak barrels for both fermentation and aging adds pleasing layers of butter and caramel. It's a French style, with a welcoming elegance.",90,23,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
"Made from 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache, this blush wine shows cool-climate acidity and a fine minerality that make it racy and clean. There also are long hangtime hints of raspberries and strawberries. It's a fine rosé to drink with bouillabaisse. From Francis Ford Coppola.",90,17,California,Monterey County,Rosé
"Rich and ripe, with some Chardonnay-like power, it's a lush mix of tropical fruit flavors—guava and banana and more. A lovely vein of caramel runs across the palate, and makes this simply irresistible.",91,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"The subtle scent of vanilla soufflé translates as a soft mouthfeel and buttered toast flavors, resulting in a wine ready for meals both casual (roast chicken and mashed potatoes) or upscale (nut-crusted halibut atop polenta). There's ample acidity, but it still falls in the traditional California Chardonnay camp.",90,22,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
"Already showing good focus and pinpoint acidity, th is wine brings green berries, kiwi and lime fruit flavors to the front. The bracing acidity keeps it lively across the palate, and the extra depth of the finish rewards your attention.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Distinctive citrus and wild sage aromas and a dazzlingly crisp balance characterize this wine. Clean, bracing fruit flavors linger on the lively finish. Grown in a small organic vineyard, this brings authenticity at a very reasonable price.",90,16,California,Potter Valley,Pinot Gris
"This savory blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah and Viognier (developed, Bridlewood claims, after tasting through the winery's lots 175 times) delivers black pepper, vanilla, stewed fig and roasted pork to the nose. It then clings to flavors like sage and sautéed plum that are more often found in cool-climate Syrah. The tannins are slightly rough, so this may be best in 2015, but it's drinking well now.",90,15,California,Central Coast,Rhône-style Red Blend
"A very drinkable Carignane made from 40–90 year old certified organic vines grown in Mendocino, punched down by hand and given the gold-glove treatment. The result is juicy and delicious, full-bodied yet somehow light on its feet, a little blueberry here, a little spice there.",90,25,California,Mendocino,Carignane
"Smooth and classy, a Cabernet that feels fine in the mouth. With a velvety texture, it shows ripe, extravagant flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, with vanilla and toast from oak barrels. Not an ager, but one of the better Cabernets to come out of Paso Robles.",90,22,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A superb wine to taste if you want to understand why Iron Horse Chardonnays are so good. With no oak, it stars pure pineapple, orange, green apple, lime and tropical fruit flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Just delicious.",90,26,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"The oak presently stands out, giving a blast of buttered toast, drizzled with honey. But the wine is very crisp in acidity and balanced and ripe in pineapples, pears and green apples. Could be an interesting bottle to cellar for four or five years.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"It took Vina Robles some years to figure Cabernet out, but they did it. The Huerhuero now is one of Paso's best bottlings, at a fair price. Dry and sufficient in acidity, its blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors are comparable to a fine Napa Cab. Drink over the next few years.",90,22,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Brilliant acidity gives this wine a clean raciness that so many Sauvignon Blancs lack. It has ripe, forward flavors of lemons, limes, apricots, peaches and honey, but despite the richness is dry and minerally.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A classic Dry Creek Zinfandel, dry, medium-bodied and spicy, with wild berry fruit and that inimitable briary note to the mouthfeel. Really pleasant, with rich, ripe berry, licorice and cedar flavors. Ideal with barbecue.",90,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Purists will find this wine a little too hot and sweet. But with its blackberry jam, dark chocolate and black pepper flavors, it sure is delicious. A great example why Petite Sirah has been such a red hot variety the past few years.",90,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Petite Sirah
"Done in a dry style, this fine effort is sourced from the Wallula Benches vineyard. It's good juice, with a delicious mix of stone fruits, citrus zest and a hint of sweet honey.",90,12,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Riesling
"Sharp and spicy, this overdelivers for the price. The tangy red and black fruits are edgy and focused, and the tannins have grip without being at all rough or unripe.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Add Hestia to the short list of Washington wineries making exceptional Chenin Blanc. Concentrated fruit flavors conjure up a smorgasbord of candied citrus—orange peel, grapefruit and lemon drops. Succulent and dense, this evolves through the finish, bringing in floral and honey overtones.",92,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chenin Blanc
"A winner from a consistently excellent winery. A distinctive tropical fruit aroma leads to lively apple and lemon flavors. It's balanced, complex, and lingering on the finish. Try with soft cheeses or shellfish.",90,25,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay
"Wonderfully fragrant, with a full-on expression of dark, plummy, black cherry fruit, this is fairly substantial. Slightly smoky tannins grip and hold through a medium-long finish. Lovely texture, with a wash of cola running through the back end.",90,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"A rich, viscous combination of 55% Roussanne, 35% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this offers a bite of creamy vanilla amidst layered, hearty and concentrated flavors of lemon chiffon. Fermented in oak and stainless steel, it aged for 11 months in French oak, only 28% of it new.",90,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Rhône-style White Blend
"Shyly aromatic at first, this beautiful Primitivo blended with 8% Barbera offers smooth layers of raspberry and just-ripe cherry, a seasoning of kitchen herbs and spice sprinkled in between. Not aged in barrels, it's all about the fruit and spice and the interplay in between, with no oak to interfere.",90,14,California,Lodi,Primitivo
"Another Fiddletown beauty, this one is pungent in blackberry and exhilarating pepper and clove. Aromatic, structured and electric with equal parts acidity and stony minerality, this wine has a long-lingering finish of gorgeous brambly fruit.",90,24,California,Fiddletown,Zinfandel
"This is likely the last vintage from this vineyard, which the family winery seemingly mastered in this bottling. There's an underlying umami-driven smoked meat backbone to the nose that also shows bold cherry blossom, olallieberry, pepper, dried herbs and blackberry-soy sauce. The palate is complex yet doesn't overpower, with bits of purple flowers, blueberry, black pepper and menthol.",94,28,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah
"A complex and complete wine with everything in place, this tastes delicious from the first whiff to the lingering finish. It has fresh-baked bread and light peach aromas and white-cherry flavors. Well balanced, it's layered on a subtle level and harmonious.",93,29,California,Anderson Valley,Sparkling Blend
"A stunning and unusual white wine out of Lodi made by Jim Moore, with tremendous aromatics of honeysuckle and melon and a genius balancing between sweetness and acidity. Grapes—technically Moscato Giallo—were harvested from the Bella Vigna Vineyard fully ripe but at low brix, allowing this bottling to maintain a very low 12% alcohol level. An amazing deal for a wine that jumps out of the glass, all bright and starry eyed.",92,16,California,Lodi,Moscato
"Another of Borra's inventive blends, this one brings together 60% Kerner, 20% Riesling and 20% Gewürztraminer. It opens aromatically with full-blown Riesling petrol. From there, the midweight texture turns to floral notes, grapefruit and herbs, along with minerality.",90,22,California,Lodi,White Blend
"Definitely dry, this wine conveys precise rose petal, lychee fruit and Gravenstein apple aromas and flavors and a lively texture. Because it's rich in body, flavors linger on the finish. It will make a great apéritif with such appetizers as goat cheese toasts and roasted almonds.",90,16,California,Potter Valley,Gewürztraminer
"A wonderfully complex, dry white wine, rich and acidic, with subtle flavors of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and honey. Feels smooth and creamy, an interesting combination of richness and tartness and, above all, elegance. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Viognier and Grenache Blanc.",92,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,White Blend
"There is 36% Barbera, 32% Carignane, 30% Petite Sirah and 2% Zinfandel in this field blend, a lushly juicy, gulpable wine that offers firm tannins and spicy red fruit, cinnamon and earth tones. A subtle streak of bacon peeks out midway and onto the finish. A great food wine, it will make all kinds of meats, pastas and pizzas sing.",90,25,California,Lodi,Red Blend
"There is an interesting floral component—white blossoms—coming through in the nose, and sailing along on top of flavors of buttered nuts. A somewhat oily mouthfeel is lifted by moderate acids, and the overall length and follow-through make this one of the better vintages of this affordably priced wine.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package.",90,16,California,Yolo County,Muscat
"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package.",90,16,California,Yolo County,Muscat
"This wine has a crisp, breezy bouquet of salad greens, melon and pear. Fresh and textural, it's balanced with a lick of wet stone to wrap up.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Flavorful and sophisticated at the same time, this wine combines honey, peach, orange and clove flavors for an experience that's not blatantly fruity, and not sweet, but delightful. Try it with Thai, Chinese, roast pork or at any outdoor occasion.",90,20,California,Anderson Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Multifaceted and sophisticated, this nearly dry Riesling packs in crisp apple and ripe peach notes. Deft balance and a lingering finish mean there's a lot to like.",90,20,California,Anderson Valley,Riesling
"Fragrantly floral, it offers ripe red fruit in delicate balance, its tannins softened and the oak imprint kept at a minimum. The vines are thought to be more than 25 years old, the clone and rootstock unknown. An elegant, tightly woven Syrah.",90,22,California,Lodi,Syrah
"A rewarding deal from the ocean-influenced vineyards of Edna Valley, this project by Nathan Carlson (general manager of the much higher-priced Center of Effort winery) delivers honey, salted nuts, tangerine zest and crushed limestone on the nose. Salinity is present on the palate, along with a lemon zing that lingers.",90,14,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"Winemaker Markus Niggli is making remarkable whites from unusual, hard-to-find grapes, in this case a blend of 50% Kerner, 25% Riesling and 25% Bacchus. This slight, seductive white dances in acidity that's got an electric mouthfeel, with a bouquet of citrus and herbs that you'll be thinking about a long time.",90,19,California,Lodi,White Blend
"Brilliant strawberry and raspberry aromas, bright and effusive fruit flavors, and a sense of freshness and purity make this wine from one of El Dorado County's oldest wineries a pleasure to drink. It's full bodied, has a smooth texture, mild tannins and a lingering finish.",92,20,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
"This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers.",92,28,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Keuka Spring Vineyards staged a remarkable renewal recently by introducing August Deimel, increasingly one of the Finger Lakes most promising young winemakers, as its head winemaker. This delightfully brisk Cabernet Franc showcases the crispness of sweet-tart black plums and cherries swathed in a finery of fresh, green herbs. It's deeply concentrated with black fruit flavors, yet elegant and refined, finishing long on a flurry of feathery tannins.",92,19,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
"A beautiful rosé, pale in color, dry and crisp in acidity. It's an elegant, elusive and tantalizing wine, rich and complex in raspberry, orange zest, mineral, vanilla, wildflower and white pepper flavors. Only 106 cases were produced.",91,25,California,Mount Veeder,Rosé
"A beautiful Pinot, not only dry and delicious in citrus, melon, pear, honey and spice flavors, but brightened with the prettiest acidity. Finishes with a mouthwatering clean tartness.",90,22,California,Carneros,Pinot Gris
"This is Mumm Napa's workhorse brut. It's a beautiful sparkling wine that satisfies the basics of elegance and lusciousness. Shows raspberry, lime, brioche and smoky flavors, with a slightly sweet dosage and a refined mousse.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"Always one of California's best Chenin Blancs, Foxen's '08 shows its usual dryness and tart, mouthwatering acidity, with flavors of citrus fruits, spices and sweet Chinese green beans. It's a sophisticated wine that takes some getting used to.",90,20,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chenin Blanc
"Sharp and spicy, the Ethos Syrah adds layers and expands into fullness as it breathes over several hours. At first tannic and slightly green, it becomes more and more appealing, the peppery fruit filling out with wild berries and tart acids.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
This has the richness of barrel fermented Sémillon (“French stainless steel”) without actually having any. Residual sugar just over 1%; gives it roundness and a hint of honey.,90,19,Washington,Red Mountain,Sauvignon Blanc
"This substantial dry rosé, mostly made from Carignane grapes, is extremely rich in color. Likewise, the flavors have plenty of juicy red wine notes like cherry, raspberry and earthy spices, and it balances well between good acidity and creamy viscosity. It can almost substitute for a red wine, and will add depth to occasions with equally flavorful food.",90,15,California,Mendocino,Rosé
"Made from Moscato Giallo grapes harvested late though still at low Brix, this is meant to serve as a dessert wine as it is slightly sweet, with 78 g/L of residual sugar. The aromas are pure and fully expressive of jasmine in bloom followed by apricot and honey. Light in alcohol, it shows a slight sweetness in the midpalate. Otherwise, it finishes dry, making it serviceable as an apéritif or midday-in-the-garden wine.",90,14,California,Lodi,Moscato
"Meaning “The Thief,” Il Ladro blends 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. A silky smooth blockbuster of a wine, it dances in acidity with bright cherry, clove and spice throughout. The tannins are well-behaved and in the background, the finish exceptionally long.",90,25,California,Lodi,Red Blend
"The grapes come from a vineyard thought to be the first planted or grafted to Tempranillo in the Mokelumne River appellation. Fields picks the fruit relatively early and treats it to only neutral oak, the result a tamed, more flavorful version of the variety. Soft, leathery, spicy and subtly loaded in blackberry and black cherry fruit, it's well worth seeking out.",90,22,California,Lodi,Tempranillo
"The wines from this producer always resemble one another aromatically in a unique way. There's bright wild strawberry and healthy handfuls of black and white pepper amidst an earthy, smoky edge. Young, firm, light on the tongue, the finish picks up substantial steam, a hit of herbal smoke there for the taking.",90,25,California,Sierra Foothills,Syrah
"What a mouthful of flavor! You don't know Muscat or Moscato until you've enjoyed this rare dry interpretation. It is aromatic and exotic, lively with fresh acidity yet full of ripe apple and peach flavors that linger on the finish. Great with salty appetizers like prosciutto or nuggets of Parmigiana.",90,20,California,Anderson Valley,Muscat Blanc
"Not afraid to wear high alcohol and toasty oak on its sleeve, it kicks off with a marshmallow, whipped cream and macadamia-nut nose, making it perfect for those who love the California cocktail style but are seeking nuance as well. On the palate, the wine is soft and buttery, with a long buttercream finish. Pair with oven-roasted chicken.",90,26,California,Paso Robles,Chardonnay
"There's a very candied red-cherry quality to the nose of this wine from a vineyard that the winery will cease using with this vintage, along with sexy aromas of violet, lilac, clove, cola, peppercorn and rose. A sage-driven character emerges once sipped, giving spice to bright red, slightly sour cranberry fruit.",92,28,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir
"A deliciously light, bright wine that hits the mark year after year, this cool-climate offering is fresh in zingy acidity and juicy flavors of grapefruit, strawberry and lime. The acidity buoys the experience from first sip to last, backed by enough body to remain in balance. This wine is fermented like a white wine without skin or seed contact.",92,28,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"Dense and luxurious aromas of oak-laden red currants, blueberry, peppercorns and melted dark chocolate greet the nose on this hearty bottling. The flavors are lighter than the nose suggests, yet the silky texture evolves quickly to deliver plenty of espresso bean, vanilla, blueberry and blackberry elements, all clinging to a strong tannic structure.",92,25,California,Paso Robles,Merlot
"Crisp and tight aromas of mandarin orange and lemonade meet with the intriguing nuance of foamed egg whites on the nose of this refreshing bottling. The mouthfeel is incredibly lively, showing flavors of lemon and lime juice, with a slight petrol touch to the palate.",92,18,California,Arroyo Seco,Riesling
"More flavorful than the rather light color might indicate, this sophisticated wine has wonderful, complex aromas like leather, tea and chocolate. Vibrant flavors of raspberry and pomegranate partner with an appetizingly dry and slightly tannic texture. It is medium to full bodied.",92,29,California,Red Hills Lake County,Mourvèdre
"The nose of this excellently priced wine offers sour fruit from Montmorency cherries, earthiness from squeezed beets, spice from toasted sagebrush and umami from soy sauce. The palate is deep, with a sanguine character that's enhanced by lots of cracked pepper. It delivers plenty of action for the price.",92,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir
"There's an exciting array of aromas on the nose of this wine, with honeydew melon, citrus candy and barely ripe cantaloupe gaining complexity thanks to fresh scents of chive, oregano and thyme. It's light and easy on the palate, with lots of yellow grapefruit freshness, a pithy edge and a singing acidity on the finish.",92,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"A faint smoky character wafts through warm, inviting aromas of lemon peels, nectarine and sea salt on the nose of this wine from Monterey County. There is a lot of energetic acidity on the palate, where even flavors of apple and pear are cut by lemon-lime briskness and a briny character.",92,25,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay
"The fruit flavors are apparent, fresh and lively in this medium-bodied, beautifully balanced brut. Light pear and pineapple aromas are followed by richer pear and citrus flavors, and subtle hints of baking spices, almonds and a nice earthy touch emerge.",92,24,California,Anderson Valley,Sparkling Blend
"With serious structure and a firm grip, this 100% Cabernet from Livermore's vaulty Concannon is a very impressive effort from a strong vintage that's easy drinking and well integrated, tasting great right now with plenty of rich tannins, pleasing blueberry and cassis with a shot of chocolate on the finish for good measure.",91,25,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A zesty, delightful Sauvignon Blanc to drink on its own, or with zesty little appetizers. Will stand up well next to a beautiful roasted chicken. It's dry and firm in acidity, and rich in cool-climate citrus, tropical fruit, lemongrass and white pepper flavors.",91,29,California,Los Carneros,Sauvignon Blanc
"The vineyard is known for its Pinot Noirs, but winemaker Bob Cabral says this is a singular block. The wine is one of the finer California Chenin Blancs, bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and clean in mineral-inspired citrus fruits. It's a complex and unusual alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.",91,25,California,San Benito County,Chenin Blanc
"Shows real pedigree in the quality of tannins, fine coastal acidity and long, rich flavors. It's a cool-climate Syrah brimming with complex blackberry, black pepper, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Feels elegant in the mouth, a fine accompaniment to a great grilled steak or chop.",90,26,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Syrah
"The 2008 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc does not shy away from the grape's natural grassy pungency. Rather, it embraces it, supporting the herbaceous aromas with ripe tree fruit flavors and some sweet spiciness from the portion (about one fifth) that was barrel fermented. A very nice combination of barrel and stainless styles.",90,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Sauvignon Blanc
"Almost exclusively Pinot Noir, this is a deeply colored, full-bodied wine, rich and crisp in strawberries, lees and vanilla. A touch of Chardonnay adds a refreshing note of lime. Delicious and easy to like, especially at this price.",90,20,California,Sonoma County,Sparkling Blend
"A super value, this new Sharecropper's offers very pretty black cherry fruit, a distinctive root beer flavor, and a bit of vanilla. It's forward and appealing, with more stuffing than most Pinots at this price.",90,21,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"Jaw-droppingly delicious, this will surely convince you that Pinot Noir is the absolute best rosé grape in Oregon. From the floral/strawberry bouquet bursting out of the bottle, right on through the delightfully sippable, mouthfilling fruit, it's a joy.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"A remarkable full-bodied wine, this has great concentration and depth of flavor, with a dense but fine-grained texture to go along with it. The color is virtually black, with a dark red rim, and the flavors are deep and delicious, like dark chocolate and blackberry jam. This is fascinating to taste now, but will be best to drink after 2018.",92,18,California,Amador County,Teroldego
"Made from mostly Pinot Noir grapes, with an addition of 8.8% Chardonnay, this Méthode Champenoise wine is sultry in raspberry cream and crème brûlée, with enough acidity to keep it fresh in the glass. The finish offers a taste of toast with ginger jam.",92,22,California,Sonoma County,Sparkling Blend
"Succulent black plums and cherries flood the palate in this irresistibly juicy yet elegantly structured Cabernet Franc. Brisk acidity lends an electric jolt, intensified by waves of granite and green herbs. Its fresh demeanor and delicate tannins make it approachable in youth, but refinement persists.",92,25,New York,Seneca Lake,Cabernet Franc
"Dried raspberries and leathery blackberry fruit get added character from violets on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling from winemaker Bruce McGuire. The palate shows lots of peppercorns and mint in its aromatic core, which is laid across tightly restrained blackberry fruit flavor.",92,28,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Syrah
"This bottling from young winemaker Michael Miroballi shows lime blossom, chalk, fresh rain on concrete and nectarine flesh on the nose. The palate is exuberant with flavors but they're not ripe, instead showing lime peels and juice, a cement-like grip and a buzzing sensation that overtakes the mouth like a Sichuan peppercorn.",92,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache Blanc
"A thoughtful blend from vineyards representing the Wahluke Slope, Yakima Valley and Columbia Gorge AVAs. Complex and nuanced, this weaves together peaches, apples, honeydew melon, pepper, cinnamon and a vein of clean, wet rock. Great structure suggests this could be cellared for another five or six years.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This is pure Merlot from the StoneTree vineyard in the Wahluke Slope AVA. It's been aged almost two years in new French oak barrels, and has the delicious mix of fruit and barrel flavors to prove it. Supple, succulent, smooth and spicy, it's a showcase for cherry and cassis fruit, accented with pungent, almost piney herb. Excellent texture and mass shows good winemaking.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Rich in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but superbly dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity, with a wonderful, stony minerality. Comes down squarely on the dry, steely side of the Chardonnay spectrum, but no less complex and interesting.",91,18,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Chardonnay
"This Meritage red is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, and 15% Petit Verdot. There are noticeable high toned aromas hinting at nail polish. The fruit is bright cherry and darker black currant, with milk chocolate coating the finish. The wine is still tightly wound and opens very slowly, so decanting is recommended.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Some Zins are “claret style,” made with the elegant structure of Cabernet Sauvignon. Not this one. It's pure, classic Dry Creek, showing that region's robust, slightly rustic tannins, explosive wild berry fruit and loads of briary, peppery tannins. It's a very fine Zin that calls for upscale beef, pork and chicken dishes.",90,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Two Syrahs are made at Barrister; this Columbia Valley bottling is chewy, chunky and tannic, with big rich red fruit flavors to match. It's muscular, a bit raw, yet drinking nicely if you don't mind a finish with some stem and bark flavors resonating through it.",90,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"This wine shows amazing complexity, subtle richness, layers of flavor and an ultrasmooth texture. A foundation of fruit flavor is very solid, and the acidity is firm and refreshing. The mouthfeel is plush and the finish lingers, making it a grand wine for a special occasion.",92,20,California,Mendocino,Sparkling Blend
"Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District. The palate is creamy down the center but with tangy edges, offering flavors of lime yogurt and pink grapefruit pith.",92,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Layered and luxurious, this medium-bodied wine tastes ripe and flavorful but not overdone, melding bright fruit flavors, almond and vanilla accents and a creamy texture that extends the finish. Suitable for a special occasion, this wine shows off the grape's inherent complexity.",92,25,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay
"Light in color and clear, this 100% varietal wine from a prime spot in Carneros known better for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay dances in the glass, a celebration of floral violet aromas and faint white pepper. Restrained and elegant, it's plenty spicy and fresh, finishing with just the right amount of red cherry.",92,28,California,Napa Valley,Grenache
"Made in the drier, leaner, earthier and more Chablisian style that's increasingly popular, this Chardonnay is a natural for food pairings, such as shellfish. It's a minerally wine, with elegant citrus, kiwi and pear flavors and a streamlined complexity.",91,24,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
"All Stillwater Creek fruit and 100% varietal, this bright and spicy, unoaked Chardonnay showcases very pretty fresh herb along with the usual green apple and pear fruit flavors. Lively and light, despite its 14.4% alcohol, it's a versatile and refreshing white.",90,21,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"A lovely, miniscule-production Mendocino Grenache, made from certified-organic grapes grown on the old vines of Testa Vineyard, some of the oldest organic vines in the North Coast. The result is a surprisingly bright, lively, fine-drinking Grenache, just as it should be, with lots of juicy cranberry and red fruit on the palate and the bones to age. A tiny bit tight when first opened, it opens up quickly and deliciously.",90,22,California,Mendocino,Grenache
"Delightful Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, dry and spicy. The citrus, melon and fig flavors have a bite of tart gooseberry.",90,18,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A six-grape Rhône blend, this does not lose focus or intensity. It strikes the palate head-on with flavors of dried leaf, prune, cooked cherry, cinnamon and mocha. But despite the raisin/prune flavors, it does not seem overripe or in any way over the hill. Rather, these superripe flavors have somehow been tamed, the alcohol is just over 14%, and the wine leaves a sinuous, sensuous trail of flavor as it moves through the palate.",90,18,Washington,Yakima Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend
"Les Chevaux blends 48% Merlot, 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Syrah, yielding a wine that is smooth, supple, and complete. It has both roundness and depth, and a lovely melding of cherry, chocolate and tobacco.",90,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Red Blend
"This pleasing blend yields a spicy, fruity wine with sweet strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Though two thirds new oak was used, it is not prominent. Smooth and accessible, this delicious wine is accented with aromas of sweet straw.",90,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"A firm mix of cranberry, stem and pepper; this would be the perfect wine to serve with your Thanksgiving turkey. It's something along the lines of a good Gamay, but with more phenolic bite.",90,21,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Dolcetto
"Tight blueberry, hot blacktop and a flash of purple flowers combine for an earth-driven nose on this wine from a hot region in southern Monterey County. The flavors are quite distinctive, with barely ripe mulberries, cedar-edged blackberries, sandalwood shavings and a touch of graphite.",92,20,California,San Antonio Valley,Tempranillo
"A standout amid a number of excellent red wines from winemaker Anthony Nappa, this unoaked Cabernet Franc (made with indigenous yeast) shines a spotlight on Cabernet Franc's raw, somewhat vulnerable expression. It's unabashedly herbal and green, almost minty, yet simultaneously luscious and berried in flavor. It's fleshy in its suppleness, yet elegantly framed within a structure of taut tannins and acidity.",92,20,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Franc
"Very light pink, this rosé offers extremely pleasant and approachable aromas of nectarine, pluot, plum, lime and a dusting of vanilla. These give way to a light and bright palate, where lime zest cuts through a bubble gum core. Yeasty notes adds further nuance.",92,28,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Pinot Noir
"Once past the horrid, impenetrable black plastic capsule, the wine rewards you with a firm, textured, interesting mouthfeel. A jumble of berries, spices, bramble, dried leaves and earth, even a dusting of cocoa, comes into play in a balanced, lingering finish.",90,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Lots of acidity and dryness in this Chardonnay. It will strike some as austere and lean. But it's fascinating in its citrus fruits and minerals, which seem to come from the stones of the Arroyo Seco. Oak influence adds much-needed notes of buttered toast. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass.",90,25,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay
"An inviting nose of buttery stewed cherries and red currants grows even more delicious thanks to smoked pork and a black-slate minerality. It's not quite so boisterous on the palate, but it features lovely cherry-pie notes, a slight orange-peel tang, some eucalyptus and a clean finish.",92,25,California,Adelaida District,Pinot Noir
"This delicious Zin has almost everything one could ask for. It offers aromas of spicy oak and enticing ripe fruit. Flavors of black cherry and blackberry layer over subtle baking spices and smoke, while a great texture combines fine-grained tannins and firm acidity. A velvety viscosity helps flavors linger on the finish.",91,15,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
"This wine over-delivers a mouthful of juicy quality vis-a-vis price, combining Cab with smaller dabs of Petit Verdot, Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Savory blackberry and cassis lift the fruitiness, seasoned in savory tones of black tea and cranberry that give it an edge. Fleshy and smooth, it's a good wine to stock up on.",91,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Both elegant and refreshing, this citrus and floral-infused wine follows the Navarro house style for whites, which includes great balance, rounded mouthfeel and honey and floral accents. It's medium bodied, vibrant with acidity and wonderfully complex.",91,16,California,Anderson Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A near replica of the wonderful 2007, and an equally powerful value. Enormously rich and attractive in pineapple cream, golden mango, lemon chiffon pie, buttered toast and dusty spice flavors; crisp Central Coast acidity makes it alive and vibrant. Only 400 cases produced, but worth the search.",93,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"Run, don't walk, to find this rich Merlot. It shows vast berry, currant, mocha, licorice and cola flavors, wrapped into superfine tannins and balanced with fine acidity. Easy to find, with 7,600 cases produced.",93,25,California,Sonoma County,Merlot
"Very unusual to get a newly released Cabernet from the 2004 vintage, especially one this good, at this price. At age six, it's fully mellow, with a silky mouthfeel framing flavors of cherries and blackberries that are starting to dry out and sweeten. There are also developing notes of mushrooms and earth. What a bargain, but only 800 cases were produced.",93,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"What a roll Mumm Napa is on with their new releases. This blush wine shows the level of richness and elegance the winery has achieved lately. Made from 85% Pinot Noir and 15% Chardonnay, it has deliciously forward flavors of raspberries, strawberries, gingersnap cookies and vanilla lemon custard, with the bubbly froth and tart yeastiness of a fine sparkling wine.",93,24,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"The first duty of a Port-style wine is to be dazzlingly rich and sweet yet balanced in acidity, and this bottling is all that. Waves of blackberry jam, cassis and dark chocolate are brightened with zesty acidity, and the sweetness level is very high.",93,24,California,Amador County,Port
"Here's a rich, easy-to-like Sauvignon Blanc. Shows keen acidity and complex flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, minerals and honey. Feels vigorous and clean all the way through to the long, spicy finish.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

"Celebrity chef Florence, in partnership with Rob Mondavi, from Folio Fine Wine Partners, has crafted this delicious, zesty Sauvignon Blanc. It's so rich in kiwi, lime, tangerine, wildflower, vanilla and mineral flavors, it's practically a food group in itself, but bright acidity grounds and balances it. Great job at a good price.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Dried red cherries, woody elderberry, dried oregano and smoked brisket aromas show on the nose of this wine by the Riboli family. The palate offers lavender and other purple-flower extracts along with plums, black cherries and lots of tobacco and cigar box complexity.",91,25,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon

"Warm aromas of lemon preserves, smoked honeysuckle and lightly honeyed Marcona almonds are cut with a citrus freshness on the nose of this estate-grown wine. A citrus-blossom character starts the sip followed by rounded saltiness and apple-flesh flavor in the midpalate. It's altogether very luscious and yet enlivening to the mouth.",91,28,California,Ballard Canyon,Roussanne
"Beeswax, lemon-laced sour cream and a peach-blossom ripeness combine on the nose of this excellently restrained wine from a highly variable, often overripe grape. There is great energy and balance on the palate, with a light nuttiness and a touch of honey that will drink well for a few years.",91,22,California,Ballard Canyon,Viognier
"One of the producer's larger-production offerings, this wine nonetheless speaks to meticulous attention in the vineyard and cellar, with velvety smoothness to the palate and savory elements of earthy mushroom. Nuanced, it ends in rose petals and black tea, with firm, crisp acidity throughout, all at an almost unheard-of price for the quality.",91,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"A slight hint of petrol on the nose of this wine by veteran Kathy Joseph then ventures into delicate and soft aromas of preserved lemons and scratched grapefruit skin. It's edgy in style, treading a pithy line of tangelo, pomelo and yellow grapefruit, with racy and lingering lemon-spritz acidity.",91,25,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Sauvignon Blanc
"Another beautifully rich, satisfying Tears of Dew from EOS. This is one of California's most consistently successful dessert wines. The '08 is very sweet and opulent in honey, apricot jam, orange sorbet and crème brûlée flavors. So easy to drink, and the alcohol is refreshingly low at 11%.",92,22,California,Paso Robles,Moscato
"Assembled from dozens of individual lots, this sumptuous brut is an example of the art of blending. Based on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's really as delicious and refined a sparkling wine as you could want for drinking now. Shows lush citrus, strawberry, honey, melon, fig and spice flavors that are wrapped into a smooth, silky bubbling mouthfeel.",92,20,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"Showing the intensely concentrated flavors of low-yielding old vines, this Zin is dense and rich in wild blackberry, briary blueberry, black pepper and cola flavors, with curious tastes that must come from the minerals in the earth. It's a bit rustic, but who cares? Break out your best grilled meats and poultry and savor this wine, if you can find it. Production was only 320 cases.",90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"The excellent aromas show the muscle and meat typical of the better Syrahs, and the concentrated palate is a well-crafted blend of brambly berry, pepper, sea salt, cured meat and loam.",90,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"A beautiful Zinfandel, lusty and smooth, that takes the variety's rustic, wild berry, tobacco, anise, herb and pepper flavors and makes them as elegant as Zinfandel gets. Strong, grippy tannins call for a salty, peppery flank steak.",90,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
"This wine is predominantly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with pinches of Syrah and Cabernet Franc blended in. Baking spice, cocoa and berry aromas lead to a layered cherry flavors that show intensity and persistence.",91,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"This is a highly unusual wine made from a traditional Champagne grape variety, with 12% of the South African Pinotage variety blended in. It Aromas like dried herbs and cedar, intriguing flavors like black tea and pomegranate juice and a beautiful balance between acidity, ripeness and a lightly tannic texture make a compelling combination.",91,20,California,Mendocino,Pinot Meunier
"One of the producer's larger-production offerings, this wine nonetheless speaks to meticulous attention in the vineyard and cellar, with velvety smoothness to the palate and savory elements of earthy mushroom. Nuanced, it ends in rose petals and black tea, with firm, crisp acidity throughout, all at an almost unheard-of price for the quality.",91,29,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"This wine offers a pleasing mixture of aromas and flavors of baking spices, pear and apple. Viscosity and weight gives it a sense of gravitas but never gets bogged down.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Earthy in black tea and leathery funk, the feral aspects of this wine are entirely compelling, giving a savory edge around grippy, full-bodied texture and weight. A Pinot for Cabernet fans, it'll stand up to steak and a whole lot more, delivering tremendous value for the quality.",91,25,California,Los Carneros,Pinot Noir
"Clean, crisp and stony aromas of lime zest, nectarine, peach blossom and chalk show on this brisk blend. There's lots of zing on the palate, with flavors of tangerine, lime and an array of citrus.",91,27,California,Paso Robles,Viognier-Grenache Blanc
"A zesty blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this shows melon, tuberose, white lily and sharp lemon zest on the nose. The palate treads between energy and warmth, offering citrusy acidity against buttered, toasted nuts, all framed by a pithy grip that keeps the texture center stage.",91,24,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style White Blend
"Crisp, yet fuller bodied, with a creamy voluptuousness to the mouthfeel, this wine offers a taste of lemon pith and peach, accented by a floral bouquet of orange blossom. Measured acidity keeps it ebullient in the glass, ending in a hit of Tahitian vanilla.",91,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Those who buy this wine because it has a cool label will not be disappointed by the fresh 'n' clean aromas of lemon rind, chalk, nectarine, pink peach and lemonade. The tight and bright palate is also a plus, with a limestone character cutting the ripe apple fruit, proving even-keeled and easy to drink.",91,23,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Awesomely rich, with massive tropical fruit, pear, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors, finished with cinnamon spice. Acidity is high and crisp, and a bright scour of minerals brings balance. Made in the modern style, this is a Chardonnay to drink with lobster and scallops.",92,28,California,Mt. Harlan,Chardonnay
"A great followup to the '08, which was one of the best Gewürztraminers of the vintage. The '09 is even better, with a crisp, minerally mouthfeel, and superrich flavors of tropical fruits, spices and honeysuckle flowers. No oak, no malolactic and just a slight touch of sweetness on the finish.",92,25,California,Green Valley,Gewürztraminer
"A terrific California blush wine, rich and compelling, with a gorgeous color, sort of a salmon-koi gold. It's bone dry and crisply clean in acidity, with strong, but not heavy, flavors of strawberries and raspberries. There's a dusting of tannins that give the wine a solid structure.",92,22,California,Russian River Valley,Rosé
"Scented with notes of pine needle and lemon polish, this puts its concentration square in the mid-palate. There are pretty traces of honeyed botrytis, and a suggestion of sweetness, though the acidity keeps it on the dry side. Excellent length, with a pretty finish of honey and tea.",90,15,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
"True to the winery's style, this wine pulls no punches, with aromas of black licorice, dark cherries and woodspice. It's rich and full bodied with a grainy feel.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend

"Very high-toned for a relatively affordable wine, this shows Key lime pith, Greek yogurt, scratched pink grapefruit skin and a fresh 7-Up soda liveliness on the nose. Anjou peas, seared green apples, lime zest and nectarine power the pleasant energy on the palate, which wipes up clean with a vanilla finish.",91,22,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"While full bodied and flavorful, this wine is not overdone. It has tempting oak aromas, and mellow fruit and spice flavors that are layered. It also offers a velvet texture that's soothing and saturated with fine tannins, and a lingering finish.",91,24,California,Amador County,Primitivo
"Coming from the relatively new but priming Kimsey Vineyard, this shows intoxicatingly rich yet never treacly aromas of ripe cantaloupe, ambrosia melon and peach-apple syrup. Glazed apples, walnut oil and orange bitters decorate the heavily layered and dense palate. Serve it with many varieties of cheese.",91,28,California,Ballard Canyon,Roussanne
"This field blend of aromatic white varieties intoxicates with its exotic haze of cinnamon, orange peel and turmeric spices. It's lusciously phenolic in mouthfeel, with a deep, penetrating core of dried peach and pear flavors that lingers on and on and on.",91,29,New York,Long Island,White Blend
"A beautiful, fancy Sauvignon Blanc, crisp and dry and complex. If you're looking for a California white to drink with a perfect roast chicken, it's a fine choice. Shows ripe, lush citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and white flower flavors, finished with dusty cinnamon spices.",93,28,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.",93,25,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.",93,24,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Super sweet, with vanilla honey, apricot preserves, tangerine tart and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Best of all is crisp, tart acidity, like a squeeze of lemon, that brightens and heightens the richness and makes it finish clean.",93,20,California,Russian River Valley,Viognier
"This bottling goes for a ripe, buttery style of Chardonnay and succeeds.

"Fresh and approachable but lean and focused on the nose, this wine shows chalk, wet slate, iodine and mandarin orange oil aromas. It's extremely limey and quinine-driven on the tangy palate, with the judicious acidity of squeezed lime and tangerine juice.",91,28,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"A blend of 80% Pinot Noir with 20% Chardonnay, this rosé sparkles in well-hewn acidity, a dry mix of white peach that's fruity and decadent in creamy waves of soft texture and yeasty bubbles. It finishes with length and breadth, an ideal match for the table.",91,24,California,Napa County,Sparkling Blend
"A slight skunky, entirely pleasant aroma of damp herbs hits the nose first on this bottling by South African vintner Ernst Storm, then a slick rush of lemon-lime peels, ripe kiwi and green apple blossoms washes in.

The wood provides firm structure without getting in the way of the fruit.",91,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is a blend of Syrah (45%), Mourvèdre (27%), Grenache (25%) and Cinsault. It charms with complex, pure aromas of boysenberry, white pepper, raspberries and herbs. The flavors are full in feel, with the judicious use of oak heightening the enjoyment.",91,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Rhône-style Red Blend
"A blend of fruit from esteemed Boushey and Red Willow vineyards, this was aged in a mixture of concrete and French oak (10% new). The herb, lemon verbana and citrus flavors are light on their feet with a creamy texture and a tart zing of mouthwatering acidity that stitches it all together.",91,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Shows great acidity that really gets the tastebuds whistling, and also deep, complex varietal flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and sweet vanilla, with a green grass component in the background. Very fine and dry, an elegant, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc of great integrity.",92,20,California,Anderson Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",92,25,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Somewhat crude and angular now, but then again, it's Petite Sirah, and mountain-grown at that. Shows considerable tannins and fresh acidity, with compact flavors of wild black and blue berries, licorice, currants and peppery spices, finshed with a flourish of dark chocolate. A very fine wine that needs time. Better after 2012.",92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Petite Sirah
"Bone dry, ultra-crisp in acidity, and lean in mineral flavors, this barrel-fermented, lees-aged Roussanne is the opposite of rich. But it's enormously elegant, and its leanness contains subtle hints of Meyer lemons, grapefruits, toast, yeast and cold, hard steel. A sommelier's dream for pairing with very complex dishes.",92,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Roussanne
"A very rich blush wine made from the same Cabernet grapes that go into the winery's expensive dry table wine.

"A wonderful Gewürz. You never know what to expect from this varietal, but in this case the wine is basically dry, and freshly crisp in acidity. The flavors are complex, ranging from oranges, pineapples and honeysuckle to star anise, toffee and the famous spices of Gewürztraminer. There's also a rich, creamy texture.",91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Gewürztraminer
"An interesting Cabernet that is softening and mellowing. The primary blackberry and cherry fruit is starting to dry out, revealing more subtle and harmonious notes. This dry, complex wine is best now and for a few more years.",91,15,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This 2009 shows the varietal's fantastic wealth of exotic tropical fruits, flowers, honey and spices. But it's also vibrant in acidity, with a core of cold minerality.",91,16,California,Central Coast,Viognier

"Complemented by 9% Sémillon, this concentrated, creamy young wine is generous in pear, peach and subtle pineapple. Tart, it remains fresh and focused in the glass, with a lushness that's memorable and compelling. An impactful finish wraps things up nicely.",91,21,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Good ripeness and a sophisticated, complex character make this full-bodied wine interesting to drink. It has classic characteristics like bell pepper and black olive aromas, along with classy blackcurrant and light spicy, oaky notes. Drink now through 2020. (Available exclusively at restaurants.)",91,18,California,Lake County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vintner Matt Villard blends Petite Sirah, Syrah, Grenache, Tannat and Petit Verdot into this whopper of a wine, which is very fairly priced.

Fine acidity and silky tannins combine for a perfect texture. Drink now and through 2013.",91,18,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"More full-bodied than the winery's brut, this Pinot Noir-based bubbly also is richer. It's just beautiful in raspberries and strawberries, with brighter touches of lime, and although the wine has a honeyed sweetness, it's zesty acidity makes it finish dry.",91,20,California,Carneros,Sparkling Blend
"Another fine success for Adelsheim, a founding Oregon winery currently on a quality roll. Elegant and crisply defined, this textbook Pinot Gris begins with a mix of fresh pear, honeydew and gooseberry, then refreshes the palate with juicy acids and some light citrus skin flavors.",91,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris

Coastal acidity provides a bracing structure for the ripe pineapple, lime, pear, white flower and mineral flavors.",92,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits. You go from flower to fruit to earth and black olive in a rush of full-bodied flavor.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, with one-quarter Sémillon, this white blend was aged on the lees in oak barrels. It shows the balanced elegance this bottling by Brander usually displays. Entirely dry, with a crisp burst of acidity, its flavors are of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and a touch of tart, New Zealand-style gooseberry. Great with roast pork or, if you can get it, wild boar.",92,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A beautiful and compelling Sauvignon Blanc that gives the acidity and citrusy brightness you want in the variety, but contains extra layers of complexity. Offers waves of fresh green grass, Meyer lemon, sweet lime and mineral flavors that don't appear to have any oak. Brilliant with crab cakes, toasted sourdough bread with goat cheese, or on its own as a cocktail sipper.",91,18,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
"A bright, focused fruitiness is the strength of this full-bodied, very ripe and enticing wine. It smells and tastes like fresh strawberries, raspberries and cherries, and feels ultrasmooth and polished in texture.

"There's a touch of reductive petrol on the nose of this wine, which is a 50-50 blend between Vogelzang and Grassini vineyards. It also offers lime zest, golden pear flesh and barely ripe peach. A cut-grass element shows on the palate as well as sour lime and Bosc pear peels.",90,28,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine comes from a single vineyard and is 100% varietal, offering dry, crisp lightness. Light oak aging provides structure underneath tart acidity and floral aromatics, providing intensity and vibrancy.",90,28,California,St. Helena,Sauvignon Blanc
"Rich, ripe black-cherry and plum flavors penetrate throughout this plump, juicy Cabernet Franc. It's decadent and forward in style, but lingering notes of spice and tea leaves lend complexity to the palate.",90,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
"This high-acid, intense wine is beautifully aromatic, with piercing and tart flavors of cranberry and raspberry, pure and laced with minerality. Terrific penetration, the persistence of wet stone, citrus, raspberry and cranberry flavors is impressive.",91,29,Washington,Yakima Valley,Grenache
"Penetrating aromatically, spicy and complex, this brings in sharp berry scents, baking chocolate and a streak of herb. It's tight and vertically structured, and once in the mouth it turns a bit hard and unyielding. But it lingers and resonates, improves after being open for several hours, and can be cellared for up to a decade.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"A really good Cabernet that compares favorably against far more expensive Napa Valley bottlings. The wine is drily elegant and complex, and the blackberry, blueberry and currant flavors are balanced with earthy notes of herbs and spices.",91,24,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A beautifully drinkable Merlot. It's softly tannic and quite dry, with a polish of smoky oak that frames deep, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and exotic spices. Very nice now and for the next 3–4 years.",91,24,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"Clean blueberry fruit and cassis fruit is buttressed with streaks of rock, graphite and coffee grounds. It has a lighter profile than many Washington Syrahs, but offers wonderful details of fresh green leaf and herb, with that powerful blueberry compote fruit filling out the finish.",91,25,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Syrah
"Still young, steely and firm, but classy and deep. This has the best attributes of the '05 and '06 Columbia Valley Cabs from Seven Hills—ripe and polished black fruits, firm tannins, a supple finish with a veneer of smoke and licorice. In other words, this is a complete, complex and intriguing Bordeaux blend, with plenty of aging potential.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stillwater Creek, Conner Lee and Bacchus vineyards provided the fruit for this young, sappy and rich Syrah. It captures the varietal character of the grape, especially as expressed in Washington State. Inviting aromas of berries and chocolate, bright and fresh, lead into brambly red fruits, umami-soaked mushrooms and moist earth.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"One of the most successful Bordeaux blends to come out of Sonoma Valley lately, this wine is dry and earthy, providing a nice alternative to today's super-fruity, overripe style. It has rewarding cherry, blackberry, red currant, mocha and licorice flavors, balanced with rich tannins. Really stylish for drinking now.",91,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay, built on a foundation of superripe pineapple, lime and golden mango fruit and elaborated with sweet, caramelized oak. Bright, zesty Edna Valley acidity balances the opulence.",90,24,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"This lovely Sauvignon Blanc was cold fermented, then aged on the lees in neutral oak barrels. That was the perfect way to treat the grapes, which were grown in St. Helena. The wine shows rich flavors of limes, green melons and lemongrass, with a softly creamy texture and a long, spicy, honey-rich finish.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This biodynamic Rhône blend is equal parts of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier, co-fermented with native yeast. It's a splendid example of the non-interventionist style, rich, and textural. The yeasty flavors are refreshing—pear and apple and cucumber fruit holding down the center—clean and solid. The wine gains power and brings in some toasty barrel flavors as it rolls into the finish.",90,22,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Rhône-style White Blend
"There's a delicate lemon scent, leading into a mix of citrus, grapefruit peel and honeysuckle. The wine gains weight in the mouth, showing ripe fruit (yellow apples) and a soft, lightly oxidized finish with toasted coconut and cracker. Quite delicious, distinctive and rich.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"A Bordeaux-style blend made primarily from Merlot, plus Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is layered with waves of blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark chocolate and oak flavors. The tannins are pure and refined. Production is 2,000 cases.",92,14,California,Oakville,Meritage
"This wine has an almost sweet aroma of ripe plums and cherries, followed by a vivid fruity flavor that's fresh, dry and accented with black pepper and clove. Showing great balance from fine tannins and good acidity and vibrant but not heavy flavor, it will be a versatile and crowd-pleasing pour.",90,20,California,North Coast,Pinot Noir
"This is a new line of label-driven wine meant to be adventurous and whimsical. Catchy label aside, the wine inside entirely delivers in well-integrated fruit and floral characteristics, showing the crispness of its stainless-steel fermentation. Tangy, it's both tart and tropical, finishing focused and lean.",90,17,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
"There's nice restraint on the nose of this judiciously priced bottling by the Delicato group, with lemon-lime citrus and slightly green apple flesh on the nose. The wine is strongly textural once sipped, with sour apple, lime peel and riper stone fruit in the background, finishing grippy and clean.",90,13,California,San Bernabe,Sauvignon Blanc
"One of the champions of the old Mission grape varietal, this winery continues to make strides in showcasing its potential in modern winemaking, This blend of 75% Mission, 15% Syrah, 5% Grenache, 4% Zinfandel and 1% Cinsault shows classic watermelon and bubblegum aromas on the nose, leading into a well-balanced palate of strawberry fruit, lime tang and a chalky minerality.",90,16,California,Paso Robles,Mission
"Not your average Pinot Grigio, this has the depth, body and complexity of a seriously delicious wine. The aromas and flavors resemble honeydew melon, watermelon and ripe peach, while the texture is smooth—almost thick—and luxurious. It will pair well with cheese and even dishes usually reserved for red wines.",90,16,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Grigio
"Leathery on the palate with sizably structured tannins, this estate-grown wine is robust in black cherry and blackberry, sprinkled subtly in black pepper, tar and coffee. Grown on the producer's BCD Vineyard off Olivet Lane, where it also grows Pinot Noir, it finishes softly, and spicy, with length.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins. Another Arbor Crest wine with a fine, fragrant bouquet, clean and bursting with fresh fruit scents. It was barrel aged for 20 months in 40% new oak, adding some strength to the tannins and hints of toast to the finish.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"The Walla Walla Syrah from Trust Cellars is enhanced with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Lewis vineyard, and coopered in 22% new French oak. There is lovely fruit here, with sweet grape, cherry and plum, followed by streaks of chocolate and caramel.",91,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"A lovely Blanc de Blancs, bright and satisfying in lime, vanilla and toast flavors, with the yeasty complexity of a fine sparkling wine. Gains extra points for the smooth quality of the bubbles.",90,24,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"A beautiful Cabernet for drinking now and over the next few years. It's dry and fine, with appealing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors all the way through the finish. Excellent price for a Cab of this quality. Easy to find with 36,000 cases produced.",90,20,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light and aromatic, this delicate and poised wine seduces with lush aromas of cherries and baking spices. It has the elegance that only fine Pinot Noir can express. Here the subtleties have been coaxed into rich expression, with details of spice and incense and chocolate truffles adding to the lingering finish.",90,22,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Pinot Noir
"Tightly wound, with big, edgy tannins that accentuate the acidity. Underneath you'll find dry, elegant flavors of tart cherries, red currants and violets. A polished, pretty wine that could pick up some nuances over the next 2–3 years.",90,25,California,Sonoma Valley,Merlot
"A very pretty rosé, one of the most attractive on the market. Made from Pinot Noir, it's light and delicate, with polished raspberry, tangerine zest, rose petal, vanilla, gingersnap cookie and cinnamon spice flavors.",90,18,California,Central Coast,Rosé
"A great buy in a smooth, dry Merlot that shows real Napa elegance and style. It's medium-bodied and lush, with appealing cherry, currant, licorice, tobacco, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now for the immediate appeal.",90,22,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"This is the least expensive of the winery's four new 2010 Syrahs, and it's the most approachable. With fine, supple tannins and a dry finish, it shows flavors of rich blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate, anise and pepper, which are enhanced with sweet oak. Only 122 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"Shy aromas of crisp yellow apple and brown sugar follow up on the palate, with compelling hints of orange blossom along the way. Quaffable and likable, it's made from 100% Chardonnay and finishes mellow and refined.",90,22,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Somehow this wine is bold, full bodied and superripe—yet balanced, sleek and structured. Tart, vibrant fruit aromas like raspberry and cranberry are followed by rich, almost sweet strawberry and red cherry flavors. A layer of fine tannins adds grip to the mouthfeel, and firm acidity keeps everything from being heavy.",90,19,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel
"Rose-petal aromas and luscious melon and grapefruit flavors give plenty of interest to this medium-bodied, dry and ultrasmooth wine from a stalwart winery. Delicious on its own for lunch or cocktail hour, it also makes a great counterpoint with Thai food and shellfish.",90,16,California,Anderson Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Despite its unoaked nature, this wine reveals elements of baked and dried fruit, and an unexpected voluptuousness of full-bodied richness. Pear, apple and lemon interplay on the palate, while tangy acidity provides a satisfying end note.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"This wine from San Ardo Ranch in the San Lucas appellation wins against Zins twice the price. Black cherry and blackberry aromas meet with sensuous lilacs and wet asphalt on the nose. The palate's cherry juice front quickly turns to tobacco, dried blueberry and a tarry, dried-berry finish.",90,16,California,Central Coast,Zinfandel
"Leathery on the palate with sizably structured tannins, this estate-grown wine is robust in black cherry and blackberry, sprinkled subtly in black pepper, tar and coffee. Grown on the producer's BCD Vineyard off Olivet Lane, where it also grows Pinot Noir, it finishes softly, and spicy, with length.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"A testament of Bellangelo's increasing winemaking prowess, this Cabernet Franc highlights fresh floral exuberance amidst a crush of concentrated sour cherry and cranberry flavors. While delicate in style and fringed by a whisper of tannins, its brambly, herbaceous complexities resonate through a long, meandering finish.",90,18,New York,Seneca Lake,Cabernet Franc
"The Edna Valley-based Talley family heads north for this blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Petit Verdot, 23% Malbec and 7% Merlot. It shows plump blueberries, blackberry jam, cream soda and black cherry syrup, as well as smoke and graphite on the nose. The palate starts with juicy cola and red currant then evolves toward snapped dark chocolate and cedar.",90,28,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A wonderfully drinkable sparkling wine that appeals immediately for its balanced texture and rich flavors. Easy to like for its array of raspberries, limes, vanilla, toast and yeast. The sour lees note is nicely balanced with the sweet liqueur of dosage.",90,20,California,Sonoma County,Sparkling Blend
"It's difficult to understand why Pinot Blanc has not become more of a cult wine in Oregon. Producers such as Ponzi make it in a style that is bright, bursting with citrus and apple fruit flavors, and elevated with a rose garden's worth of floral highlights. This wine would be a perfect start to a holiday meal.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
"Amity's dry Gewürztraminer is one of Oregon's finest, and a major strength of the winery. In this new vintage it shows broad and rich flavors, that run the spectrum from floral and spicy to sweetly honeyed. It's dry, make no mistake, but carries an impression of fruit sweetness. The deepening gold color suggests some early oxidation, and the caramel and toasted grain flavors are already at their peak.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Young, tart and vividly bright, this spicy wine brings Asian pear and cool citrus flavors to the forefront. It holds well through a lingering finish, with a crisp, piercing, phenolic grip reminiscent of grapefruit rind.",90,22,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Blanc
"This is 100% varietal, this winery's most popular varietal offering, and nicely distinguished from its other reds. Recently bottled, it was still slightly shocked when tasted. Dark fruits, most especially cassis, are woven together with smoke (no mirrors!) and bitter chocolate. Chewy, earthy tannins hold the finish and complement the wine's natural peppery spice.",91,28,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Cabernet Franc
"A beautiful wine. If more Syrahs were like this, especially at this price, more people would buy them. It's dry and smoothly tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, bacon, chocolate and peppery spices. Try as an alternative to Zaca Mesa's much more expensive single vineyard and reserve Syrahs. It's almost as good.",91,23,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah
"There's no oak on this Chardonnay, but it's so rich, you don't even notice. It's all pure, ripe pineapple, orange and lime fruit, accompanied by tart, clean Green Valley acidity. Tremendously versatile with food.",90,26,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"This is 90% Malbec and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon; it's dark, toasty, smoky, earthy and dappled with ground coffee flavors. The fruit holds its own—it's tight and tart and firm, with plenty of blackberry flavor. This wine keeps resonating through the palate into a solid, textural finish.",90,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec
"Good price for a Cab this good. It's dry, rich and complex, with blackberry, cherry, currant and herb flavors wrapped into firm, dusty tannins. Not an ager, but beautiful now for its elegance.",90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fairly dark and full-bodied for a rosé, but the wine is completely dry and crisp in acidity, and the cherry, orange rind and spice flavors are nicely grounded with minerals. A serious rosé that you can drink with steak or lamb chops.",90,24,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Syrah may well be the standout grape among all that the Milbrandt brothers do well in their 13 vineyards. Here it captures the grape's authentic toasty, meaty, earthy character (well supported with oak) and wraps it around pure black cherry fruit. Supple and long-lasting.",90,25,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah
"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay seemingly tastes as sweet as a dessert, although it's technically dry. With its pineapple and tangerine tart, crême brulée and Key lime pie flavors, Chardonnay doesn't get richer than this. Brisk, citrusy acidity gives much needed balance.",91,24,California,Sonoma County-Lake County,Chardonnay
"A very well-built and elegant dinner wine, this smells like boysenberry and black pepper. It tastes nicely reserved and almost meaty, with moderate tannins to add grip to the texture. It should pair nicely with a roast or braise.",90,25,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot combines the sharp, herbal edges of Cabernet with the plumminess of Merlot to fine results. Umami notes of brine, mushroom and forest floor add savory complexity. It's a complex yet thoroughly approachable wine that's drinking elegantly now.",90,26,New York,Seneca Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Honeysuckle, mineral, honey and botrytis aromas lead the way. This drinks off dry with exceptionally well-balanced acidity that carries through the lingering finish.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Boysenberry, black pepper, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of asphalt gather for a delicious nose on this blend of 47% Petite Sirah, 45% Syrah, 5% Grenache and 3% Mourvèdre. Flavors of purple fruit and flowers are elevated by boisterous acidity and peppery spice that singes the palate and makes the eyes water.",90,20,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend
"Cocoa, plum and vanilla aromas are followed by creamy-feeling blue-fruit flavors that display a mixture of fruit and barrel. The barrel influence is heavy, but it's delicious all the same.",90,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Great structure meets abundant fruit flavors in this big but well-balanced wine. The aromas are like Bing cherries and dark-roast coffee, while flavors recall dark chocolate and boysenberries. While obviously tannic and robust in texture, it seems to melt in the mouth for a smooth and lingering finish.",90,19,California,Mendocino County,Syrah
"A picture perfect Sauvignon Blanc. Really defines the variety in California, with rich, ripe tangerine, pear, green melon and vanilla spice flavors, brightened with brisk acidity. Shows a lot of complexity and class, and look at that price. Easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced.",90,12,California,Monterey County,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a delicious, brut-style wine, based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It's very rich in strawberry, raspberry and lime flavors, with vanilla and toast complexities, and the finish is honey-sweet and spicy. Great price for a bubbly this elegant.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Sparkling Blend
"A very fine effort, with classic cassis and black cherry in the fruit core, but also offering interesting details of bark, earth and herb. The wine lingers, perhaps due to excellent natural acidity, and without overpowering the palate it keeps tantalizing it with nuances of moist earth and wet rock.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aged in neutral oak and 100% varietal, this is a fine value. There is great fruit flavor—raspberry and Bing cherry—supported with natural acidity and just a hint of chocolate. This could be a Dry Creek Zinfandel, in terms of its bright berry fruit and lively acidity.",90,16,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Sangiovese
"A very pretty Merlot, and a good price for the elegant quality. It's dry and tannic, showing the Clos du Val style of controlled, somewhat aloof ripeness. There's a rich, attractive core of black cherry fruit. Will develop for a few years, but it's really best now, with a brief decant.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"Another fine value from Kirkland, the Costco house brand. Vineyard sources are first rate, mostly Wahluke Slope, and the wine has exceptional grip, depth and structure for Merlot at this price point. Cassis, dark plum, black cherry, licorice, espresso and smoke are woven together nicely. Tannins are lush, substantial and quite ripe; they wrap up the wine with a blanket of smoke and tar. A great steak wine.",90,10,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Winemaker Joe Forest has brightened the fruit and livened up the mouthfeel by blending in 20% Grenache. Fresh raspberry flavors are wrapped into the earthier, herbal, lightly chocolaty character of the Syrah. Once-filled French barrels were used.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Capturing the dense essence of Petite Sirah, this marries deep berry flavor to a highlight of Bourbon-soaked chocolate. It's not overly sweet, but it's definitely a dessert wine.",91,24,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Petite Sirah
"Rich and creamy, this has a smooth, buttery mouthfeel, carrying flavors of ripe peaches, pears and limes. Santa Lucia's cool climate helps to bring this wine a brisk cut of mouthwatering acidity. Production was 784 cases.",91,24,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"A mighty fine white wine. Fills the much-needed niche of extreme dryness, acidity and restraint, which are the hallmarks of elegance. Call it the anti-Chardonnay. A Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend with some barrel and sur lie influence, it's rich and crisp in Meyer lemon, pear, fig, vanilla and smoky butter flavors.",93,25,California,Napa Valley,White Blend
"Very forward in fruit, offering a powerful wave of pineapples, oranges, lemons, limes and peaches. Fortunately, all this richness is dry, and brightened with crisp, tart acidity. Suggests a rich lobster or shrimp risotto.",90,27,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"A polished, softly delicious Merlot, at a good price for the quality. It's dry and richly tannic, with complex flavors of black cherries, red currants, red licorice, Indian spices and sandalwood. Ready now, but only 200 cases were produced.",90,24,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"A beautiful Chardonnay at a great price compared to what's out there. Shows brilliantly ripe pineapple, pear and guava flavors, with crisp Central Coast acidity and a bracing minerality. Nice to drink by itself, with shellfish or even with a citrus fruit pastry for dessert.",90,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Lovely aromas mingle baking spices, white pepper, red fruits and black cherries. It's a little light in terms of body, but not color or scent. The tannins are herbal and chewy, and the finish carries a pleasing floral note.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"The winery's very limited riserva bottling is made in a single 500-liter puncheon and for the first time features Boushey vineyard fruit. Tannic and displaying impressive mass, it offers somewhat liquorous plum and cherry fruit flavors, with smoke and licorice streaking through the finish.",90,26,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sangiovese
"A beautiful Chardonnay notable for its food-friendliness. Strikes a firm path toward dryness and minerality, with suggestions of citrus, peach and vanilla. The racy acidity is wonderful. Defines elegance in Chardonnay, at a good price.",90,18,California,Mendocino County,Chardonnay
"Great price for a Cab this good, and surprising that it's nonvintage. Toasty oak stands out, not unpleasantly, and then the blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate kick in. Holds its own among far more expensive Napa Cabernets.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bright and spicy, this has flavors of melon and pear. Balanced throughout, it finishes with a lightly toasty accent. Superb winemaking shines here.",91,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Tangent's white wines, which are unoaked, get better each vintage. This Grenache Blanc is exquisitely sculpted with sharp acids and pinpointed minerals, and offers orange, melon and vanilla-honey flavors. A delight to drink, at a great price.",91,17,California,Edna Valley,Grenache Blanc
"Creamy and leesy, with a complex mix of mineral, fresh herb, citrus rind and pungent botanicals, this is an interesting and refreshing style of Pinot Gris. Give it a good chill and watch it open as it warms.",91,16,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Full and round, with snappy acidity that brings life and lift to the luscious fruit, this delicious wine is aimed at those who like a festival of green and yellow fruits in their glass. It has fine texture and length, with a defining mineral streak that elevates this well beyond just fruity. It has medium-term aging potential as well.",91,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"This is an impressive young Cabernet: It's bone dry, tannic and intense, with flavors of mountain blackberries and black currants. It may even age for a few years.",91,26,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Since 1993 Arbor Crest has done this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc. As with all these wines the aromas set up the palate—scents of berry, tobacco and fresh ground coffee. In the mouth it carries on with very clean and fresh fruit, ripe and chewy/herbal tannins, excellent acid balance and a light bitter coffee finish.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"A big (15.6% alcohol) and assertive Rhône blend. Red Mountain's iconic Ciel du Cheval vineyard is the source of the excellent fruit, which brings a mix of black pepper, wild ferns, herbs, tart raspberries and cold stone. Penetrating and compact.",90,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Red Blend
"This is a smooth, rich and very drinkable Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows ripely classic flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and cedar. The tannins are brisk and furry, but the wine doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Good now and through 2014.",90,19,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark and juicy, the tight flavors are a mix of black cherry and cassis, with a tart mouthfeel and smooth finishing tannins. Though it sees 60% new oak, the wine spends relatively little time in those barrels, and doesn't show as much oak influence as you'd suspect. A firm finish from Red Mountain tannins brings in dark chocolate, smoke and coffee grounds.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"This pure Malbec is a blueberry pie wine right down to its bones, with refreshing acidity and some steely tannins right behind. It also has a lovely floral note that comes out strongly with some hours of breathing.",90,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Malbec
"This nicely crafted Syrah is sourced from the Lewis, Porteuss, and Sundance vineyards. The barrel regimen was 25% new and 100% French, with minimal racking, unfined and unfiltered. Flavors are compact, a classic mix of wild berry, loam, seaweed and bitter herb. Not for fruit hounds, but detailed and deep.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Assertive, tannic, and earthy, this includes generous and pretty plum and black cherry fruit in the core. A nice mix of tart, ripe fruit with the interesting flavor components of leaf and herb, olive and licorice, that extend the finish and put a frame around the fruit.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hibiscus and honeysuckle scents highlight the bouquet, while the palate bears flavors of pears and spices, buoyed by natural acidity. Aging in 30% (neutral) barrels puts some extra flesh on its bones.",91,17,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Gris
"This has Cabernet Sauvignon-driven flavors of ripe summer blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak. It's dry with smooth tannins, and it shows lots of class. With 8,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.",91,29,California,Napa Valley,Red Blend
"Due to extraordinarily sharp acidity in 2011, this tastes quite dry despite residual sugar of 1.9%. A green berry flavor is matched to elements of mineral and fruit skin, lending length and texture to the wine.",90,28,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Riesling
"This is a very fruity-rich Zinfandel. It pushes the envelope on power and almost goes over the top, but wisely stops short in favor of balance, with acids and tannins providing needed finishing structure. The flavors are big and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries, blackberries, plums and chocolate, not to mention huge spiciness. Perfect with short ribs of beef.",90,29,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"There's something rustic and spicy and earthy about Dry Creek Chardonnays, but Ed Sbragia manages to lift this wine into opulence. It's pretty oaky, yet the vanilla and honey flavors marry perfectly with the pineapple and pear fruit to produce a wine of great attraction.",92,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Chardonnay
"Rich and creamy, with the mouthfeel of a good Chardonnay, and exotic flavors of honeysuckle, lemon custard, buttered toast and spices. Just delicious.",92,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Blanc
"Very rich and dramatic, offering creamy tiers of grilled pineapple, lemon custard, Asian spices and smoky oak, accented with crisp, refreshing acidity. Very high quality for the price.",92,27,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"This wine shows what a fine place Dry Creek Valley is for growing Sauvignon Blanc. With no oak at all, it's clean and brisk in citrusy acidity, with refreshing peach, lime, green grass, tropical fruit and spice flavors.",90,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Beautiful. With crisp, tart coastal acidity, it offers lush waves of black cherries, anise, Asian spices and smoky vanilla, in a silky, elegant mouthfeel. Great value for the quality.",92,26,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"Here is a very nice take on Riesling, gleaned from high-density vines. It captures the density and grip of the bone-dry Australian Rieslings, with the added concentration of Northwest fruit. An extra bonus—it's just one percent residual sugar and 12.5% alcohol; a beautiful proportion that feels dry, carries some light honeyed sweetness in the finish and does not tire the palate. Editors' Choice.",91,25,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Riesling
"A lovely wine, rich and exotic, yet dry and balanced. Shows exotic flavors of spiced pears, pineapple punch, honeysuckles, butterscotch and Asian spices, in a creamy texture. Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Viognier.",91,24,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style White Blend
"There is lots to like in this Chablis-like Chardonnay. It's dry, bright in acidity and minerally, with an undercurrent of citrus, Asian pear and tropical fruit flavors. Oak plays a subtle but essential part in the wine's richness.",90,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"Lovely aromatics introduce this elegant, light, yet truly satisfying Pinot Noir. Balanced and complex, it shows classic scents and flavors, with Burgundian character. It would not be surprising if this wine lasted a decade or more.",90,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"Solid as ever, this lip-smackingly refreshing Auxerrois is brimming with fine flavors of apple, pear and peach. The cool vintage has lowered the alcohol a touch, and there is plenty of acidity. The fruit purity and compelling aromatics remain as good as ever.",90,22,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Auxerrois
"This unoaked, tank-fermented, no-malolactic style delivers flavors as crisp and refreshing as a clear mountain stream. Steely and mineral-driven, its apple and pear flavors carry just a tongue-tickling hint of butter.",90,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"A Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now, this has a pleasingly tart yet creamy mouthfeel, with rich, complex flavors of tropical fruit, lemongrass, peach and vanilla that finish in a swirl of peppery spice.",90,21,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Sauvignon Blanc
"Clean and sleek on the palate, this wine has brisk Central Coast acidity, which highlights the complex flavors of green melon, lemon, lime, Asian pear and white pepper. Made without oak, it shows the wonderful terroir of its vineyard.",90,13,California,Edna Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Estate-grown grapes ripened to 25 brix deliver a substantial Viognier, dense with citrus fruit, lemon zest, pineapple and mineral flavors. It's concentrated and expressive, with mouth-cleansing acids and refreshing purity.",91,21,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Viognier
"Dark, bone dry and very tannic, this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend has a fine structure. In the mouth it feels rich and earthy, but offers fruitier flavors of currants, limned in sweet, smoky oak. Very Bordeaux-esque.",91,25,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Soft and luxurious, this is made from Merlot and Cabernet, and it offers rich, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, dark chocolate, herbs, spices and cedar.",90,18,California,Rutherford,Meritage
"Exotic and rich, with tropical flavors of passionfruit, papaya and Asian pear, accented with flowers, minerals, spices and smoke. Crisp acidity makes the wine feel clean and brisk.",90,20,California,Paso Robles,Viognier
"Firm in tannins, with deep, lush flavors of wild cherries baked into a pie, black raspberries, mocha, tobacco, herbs and spices. For all that richness, there's good, dry structure. Nice with lamb and rosemary potatoes. Cabernet, Syrah and Petite Sirah.",90,28,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend
"Good price for a Cab from this small, prestigious appellation. The wine is bone dry and dense in mountain tannins, with rich flavors of black cherries, blackberries, currants and wild herbs, like rosemary. Shows real elegance and style. Now–2012.",90,18,California,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This has been one of the best, most consistent bottlings of Chenin Blanc in California, and Ballentine deserves credit for sticking with it. The wine is a fine alternative to Sauvignon Blanc, dry, crisply acidic, and rich in citrus, spearmint, pepper and Asian pear flavors.",90,15,California,Napa Valley,Chenin Blanc
"Crisp and glossy, this refreshing, stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc has the appropriate varietal flavors of fresh herb, sweet grass, lime and grapefruit. The flavors of citrus and herb are in perfect balance and complement each other perfectly.",90,17,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Tart and tangy, with cleansing acidity, this is a Pinot Gris ready for fresh shellfish, oysters, and mussels. The lemony fruit is marked by a touch of pineapple, showing good focus, concentration and length.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"A blend of 54% Pinot Noir and 46% Chardonnay, this sings a strawberry-tinged note on the palate. It's enveloped by flowery aromas of rose perfume. It's round and easy to drink, and the finish is quick but satisfying.",90,23,California,Mendocino County,Pinot-Chardonnay
"This blend of Tempranillo, Malbec, Dolcetto, Merlot and Syrah could have turned into a generic red, yet it is seamless and nicely proportioned. It's a real crowd-pleaser, with a ripe red-fruit flavor and generous new-barrel-derived toast and spice notes.",90,15,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Red Blend
"Quite dark and dense, generous and ripe, this Grenache offers a mix of red and black fruits. The flavors continue onto a finish that's rich with kirsch and coffee.",90,26,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Grenache
"Although this is ready to drink now, it offers considerable tannins that are wrapped around layers of blackberries, black currants and cedar. The structure is impressive, so let it breathe in a decanter for an hour or two before serving.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The lovel floral aromas are a pure expression of the grape's unique spice and rose petal characteristics. It's deeply flavorful, soft, elegant and lingering, with a lychee flavor.",90,14,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Impressive for the way the cherry fruit explodes in the mouth, so rich and opulent, then turns wonderfully dry and clean on the finish. It's a beautiful Pinot Noir, silky and spice. At this price it's perfect for restaurants.",90,21,California,Monterey,Pinot Noir
"A blend of two-thirds Chardonnay and one-third Pinot Noir, this emits an inviting whiff of caramel apple. On the palate, the frothy mousse is dry and balanced.",90,20,California,Mendocino County,Sparkling Blend
"In the past, the winery made a Mendocino appellation Chardonnay from a mix of Anderson Valley and Potter Valley fruit. But in 2010, all of the fruit is sourced from the Anderson Valley. This is fleshy, soft and lush, bearing grapefruit and fig flavors that are wrapped in a tightly focused package with a bright finish.",90,17,California,Mendocino,Chardonnay
"A beautiful Riesling, perfect for a cocktail or with a wide range of fare. Bone dry and richly acidic, it shows true varietal flavors of citrus, honeysuckle, diesel or lighter fluid, minerals and gardenia flower. This is a wine that sommeliers should scoop up, but only 450 cases were produced.",90,15,California,Monterey,Riesling
"Made in an accessible, pleasing fashion, with sweet, smoky oak framing ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and honey. Easy to find, with 6,169 cases produced.",90,25,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"It is one of the mysteries of the universe how negociant Cameron Hughes produces wines like this at such a great price. It is a Zinfandel lover's Zinfandel, rich and peppery and briary. Really satisfies with wild forest red and black berry flavors tingled with tons of spice, and finishes dry and balanced.",90,13,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"Dry and meaty, with tannic flavors of grilled beef, blackberries, smoky oak, pepper and other spices. Feels dense, solid and vital, a wine that could develop bottle complexity through 2013. It's a blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",90,28,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend
"Quite a rich Chardonnay. Floods the mouth with sweetly ripe pineapple tart, buttered toast, vanilla crème brûlée and cinnamon flavors. Fortunately, a backbone of crisp acidity provides balance.",90,18,California,Paso Robles,Chardonnay
"Tannicly dry, but balanced and complex, with a silky, rich mouthfeel. Almost like a Chinon, although it has no Cabernet Franc. Under the tannins are rich flavors of cherries, red currants, violets and cedar. Now-2012.",90,27,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"The tall, green-tinged bottle is Hall's way of signaling that the wine is dry, and indeed it is. Really nice and crisp, it shows lime, pear, green apple, lemongrass and spice flavors, made clean with rich acidity. Sommeliers, scoop this one up. Best Buy.",90,15,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc
"Here's a rich, bone-dry Chardonnay that shows long hangtime flavors of peaches, apricots, tangerines, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle, custard and tangy minerals. It's brightened with crisp acidity. Super-drinkable.",90,24,California,Carneros-Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery. Luscious aromas—stone fruits, candy, wax, peel, honey, cumin, allspice—it just keeps on going. Firm in the mouth, with the same exotic and refined blend of interesting spices and fruits. A tour de force.",94,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Roussanne
"A full-throttle effort, with big flavor swashes of blackberry, cassis, black pepper, coffee grounds and ripe tannins. This is Cold Creek Merlot at its most powerful; the 35-year-old vines are in their prime and the flavors show it. Few American Merlots—indeed few in the world—can stand on their own and deliver a wine this complete and powerful. It needs more years to knit together, but no worries—this is a 20-year wine.",94,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"A sexy, lush, flat-out beautiful nose introduces this dusty, decadent wine. The blackberry fruit is ripe and highlighted with pastry spices and crust with hints of light dried herb. It is starting to move into secondary fruit flavors, lush and round and full-bodied, and the finish adds veins of earth and smoke and forest floor. Really a revelation.",93,24,Washington,Yakima Valley,Tempranillo
"Syrah does well all over Washington, but the Lake Chelan region has a particular mix of qualities that are most appealing. The scents swirl through a circus of attractions—coffee and toast, berry and cassis, loam and funk, spice and citrus peel. They seem to go on almost infinitely. The flavors continue along the same lines; just as you think you've nailed them down, they morph into something new.",93,28,Washington,Lake Chelan,Syrah
"Right out of the chute this has sappy, delicious black cherry fruit, accented with scents of tobacco and graphite. Streaks of ash and more juicy berries fill the middle, as it unfolds into a taut, sculpted finish. A classical style from a vintage that favors it; accessible, yet built for cellaring.",93,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
"This is a great price for a Chardonnay of this sophistication. It satisfies for the buttercream, buttered toast and vanilla richness to the pineapple and pear fruit, yet is balanced with crisp acidity and a minerally elegance. Drink now.",90,20,California,Chalk Hill,Chardonnay
"Shows real Stags Leap character in the dusty tannins, dryness and power, yet appeals with lush cherries, currants, spices and cedar. It's balanced and harmonious now, and should develop over the next six years.",90,25,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry Creek Valley developed a reputation for keen Sauvignon Blancs a long time ago, and Sbragia has captured that tradition. This wine is dry and crisp and minerally, offering tart, food-friendly flavors of limes, lemons and kiwi, with richer hints of golden mango.",90,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"When Bernardus gets Sauvignon Blanc right, which they did in this vintage, they avoid those notorious feline aromas and go straight toward fruit. This is such a wine. It flatters the mouth with Meyer lemon cream, pineapple tart and vanilla flavors, accented with minerals and richly edged with crisp acidity. With a bit of buttered toast from partial barrel fermentation, it's just delicious.",90,16,California,Monterey County,Sauvignon Blanc
"Very dry and tannic, yet refined and elegant, with a structure that keeps you coming back. Shows deep flavors of blackberries, currants, violets and cedar. Impresses for its all-around volume and length. Decant for a few hours.",90,28,California,Paso Robles,Meritage
"Here's a big, thick, full-bodied and extracted wine that captures the essence of Dry Creek Valley Zin. Its marked by extremely briary, brambly flavors of wild blue and black berries and cola. Then the spices kick in, starting with black pepper, ranging through cinnamon and star anise, and then finishing with black pepper. Totally, completely bone dry and quite tannic and acidic, this Zinfandel needs rich fare, and should develop in the bottle over the next 4–5 years.",93,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"An outstanding value, this Walla Walla Valley Cab is awash in black fruits and black flavors—toast, coffee, smoke, licorice, graphite, and black olive. Tannins are silky and the length suggests a wine that will age gracefully.",92,26,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman. Yeasty and young, dense and loaded with fresh pear, toasted nuts and butter, this is seductive and immensely enjoyable.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Hard to believe this Sauvignon Blanc never saw oak, because it has a vanilla bean flavor that must come from the grapes alone, although lees aging surely contributes to the creaminess. The underlying flavors are complex, ranging from Meyer lemons and sweet limes to exotic tropical quince, kiwi and guava and just a touch of gooseberry. Best of all is the acidity, which brightens everything. A great Dry Creek Sauvignon Blanc.",92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Winemaker Mike Lee continues to prove his prowess with Sauvignon Blanc in this latest vintage of Patianna, Patti Fetzer's line of organically farmed wines from outside of Hopland in Mendocino County. Fermented entirely in stainless steel without undergoing ML or barrel aging, it delivers everything you love about the variety, inviting one in with melon and minerality, then following through with a surprising creaminess and almost decadent, mousse-like finish.",93,17,California,Mendocino,Sauvignon Blanc
"The best Truchard Syrah in years. It's full-bodied and spicy, with tremendous flavors of blackberries, cassis, smoked meats, pepper and sandalwood. A little rustic, and a perfect accompaniment for grilled steak.",92,28,California,Carneros,Syrah
"This and the '09 may be the last Syrahs until a new planting is made. Scents of violets, cassis, tobacco and licorice create cross currents that swirl around the palate, along with tangy, tasty blueberry fruit. Tight and densely layered, this is a sleek, well-crafted effort that finishes with a spicy kick.",92,26,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Syrah
"A fragrant, rich mix of olive, smoke, earth, black cherry, cassis and more. It offers fine value, good texture, grip and a very appealing, silky-smooth evolution in the finish.",92,24,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Merlot
"The 2009 vintage blend is 41% Marsanne, 42% Grenache Blanc, 10% Picpoul and 7% Roussanne. Complex, rich and dense, it wraps its stone and tropical fruit flavors in layers of caramel, nougat, marshmallow and spice. Still quite young, with plenty of years of life ahead.",92,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,White Blend
"Winemaker Peter Rosback spends a month each year making wine in New Zealand, and captures some of the same fresh, grassy character in this Sauvignon Blanc from the Oregon slice of the Columbia Valley. Bone dry, dusty, sweetly herbal and a bit softer than the 2007, this brings similar fruit flavors, hinting at white peach, lemon rind and pineapple. Lovely finish.",90,20,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Sauvignon Blanc
"From estate fruit, this is a cut above most similarly priced Oregon Pinot Gris. The nose sends up a lively mix of cilantro and other sweet herbs, leading into ripe pear-flavored fruit. Flavors meld and linger, acids refresh, and the wine takes a lovely, lazy stroll down your palate, inviting another sip.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Made in a dry, tannic style, this Cab-based wine offers a nice alternative to today's overripe, soft Cabernets. There's a firmness in the mouth and a rich earthiness to the blackberries, black currants and cedar. This chewy, impressive wine will develop through 2012 or so.",90,26,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"What a treat! Smoky, moist loam, coffee grounds, dried plum, anise, tobacco—a fully mature, complex and detailed wine at its peak. The veins of flavor keep coming through, adding dried leaves, sassafras and more, as it weaves through the finish.",92,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Though many winemakers insist that Syrah has become a difficult sell, this is a wine that has attracted a big following. What's not to like? It's juicy, sappy, grapey and penetrating; a peppery bottle of ripe fruit flavor. Young and tart, vivacious and powerful, it's delicious now or ready for another six to eight years of cellaring.",92,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"A beautiful Zinfandel, and quite a bit better than the '06. Shows great concentration of varietal flavors of briary, freshly picked wild black, blue and red berries, bacon, cola and black pepper, with a sweetness from high alcohol that actually works in the wine's favor. Drink now with very rich grilled meats, stews and hard cheeses.",92,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"A thoroughly enjoyable Zinfandel that shows the variety's lusty character, but with special grace and finesse. Bone dry and richly tannic, it has complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries and currants, with earthier notes of tobacco, leather and unsweetened dark chocolate. Very fine.",92,22,California,Fiddletown,Zinfandel
"This is a blend of the various vineyards Conn Creek has access to. It is a splendid testimony to the winemaker's ability to take disparate lots and make them harmonious. Just a beautiful Cabernet, dry and softly luscious, with complex blackberry, black currant, anise and cedar flavors. A wonderful experience now, and it should develop in the bottle for several years.",93,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"If this Syrah was from Napa, or even Sonoma, it would cost a lot more. It's really good, with fine tannins framing delicious, complex flavors of ripe berries, cured meats, peppery spices and smoky sandalwood. Sophisticated and elegant, it's worth a special search. Only 476 cases were produced.",92,25,California,Paso Robles,Syrah
"Just one word for this Zin: delicious. It's really classic Dry Creek, maybe a little softer than many, but profoundly ripe in wild berry, cherry, cola, licorice, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish long and deep. Great price for a Zinfandel this good.",92,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"This blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc avoids all the pitfalls and manages to achieve true elegance. It's bone dry, with wonderful acidity and complex flavors of citrus fruits and minerals. Really impresses for the clean, captivating structure.",92,25,California,Napa Valley,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Just a whiff of this deep gold Vidal Blanc reveals layers of smoke melded with honey and fresh apples. The palate is deeply complex with flavors that include pretty florals, rich pineapple, citrus and a compelling smoked nut skin note. The super-long finish is marked by zippy acidity and a lovely astringency.",92,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Vidal Blanc
"A great find from the Livermore Valley, whose pockets of coolness lend complexity to the valley's wines, this Syrah is delicate and lively, feminine in style with subtle fruit and sage notes and nicely wound acid.",92,20,California,Livermore Valley,Syrah
"Superbly smooth—satiny is really the right word—this luscious Chardonnay pulls together papaya, banana, pineapple and apricot fruit into a seamless, sensuous, full-bodied whole. There is just enough acid to keep it upright, and lightly applied notes of barrel spice, caramel and toast.",92,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"As weighty as a Chardonnay, this is a Sauvignon Blanc whose nuances will be killed if you over-chill it. You could even decant it for a while and let it approach room temperature. Dry and rich, it shows savory, complex tiers of pineapples, limes, green apples, sweet golden tobacco, vanilla, white pepper and even a touch of thyme.",92,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"The second vintage of Salida's Tempranillo from Two Coyote vineyard fruit is a wine with tight structure, a wireframe of tannin and mineral supporting beautiful aromatics. A subtle, evocative wine, it instantly explodes with violets, cherries and berries. Then it seems to stop short, though it doesn't fade; rather, it hits a wall. Compact, dense with exotic scents and spices, and great structure. Give it time.",92,24,Washington,Yakima Valley,Tempranillo
"Another stunner from Uvaggio, who is making stellar wines across the board from Lodi grapes, low in alcohol (13%) and fairly priced. This fruity Primitivo can be enjoyed all night from before a meal to during to a bedtime sendoff—it just gets better and better in the glass. Pomegranate, cherry, toffee, they're all in this soft, easy-drinking wine.",92,16,California,Lodi,Primitivo
"All Malbec, with appealing purity and a core of raspberry and cassis fruit. Nuanced notes of dried leaf, herb and green olive add character. The grapes were ripened nicely, the tannins are polished and smooth, and the wine flows deliciously into a lingering finish.",91,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Malbec
"Pure Marsanne, a gorgeous bottle, vivid with brightly illuminated stone fruits, citrus rind, a streak of caramel and a full-throttle finish. Full-bodied, long-lasting and flavored somewhere between a rich Chardonnay and a high-toned Viognier.",91,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Marsanne
"One of the better Sauvignon Blancs out there for its richness and concentration. With citrus, tropical fruit, lemongrass, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors, the wine shows a fine structure, with brilliant acidity and a clean finish.",91,20,California,Oakville,Sauvignon Blanc
"2008 was a great vintage for Tax, and this Santa Barbara bottling is a great value. It really delivers, offering a dry, elegantly structured and complex wine. The silky texture houses savory flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and sandalwood, with an umami taste of bacon. Just delicious for drinking now.",91,23,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir
"Could be a Sauvignon Blanc, with Meyer lemon, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, accented with crisp acidity. That's no disrespect. It's a compliment, in this age of clumsy, overoaked Chardonnays. Elegant and food-friendly, it's brightened with the acidity of a fresh lime.",91,22,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"A lovely wine, drinkable now and over the next few years. Made from Merlot, the two Cabernets and a dash of Syrah, it's rich and lush in blackberry, blueberry, cured meat, black pepper and cedar flavors, wrapped into smooth, spicy tannins.",91,25,California,Alexander Valley,Red Blend
"One of the drier, crisper white Rhône-style wines out there, and hence one of the best. These Viognier, Grenache Blanc and Marsanne blends tend to be too sweet, but this one's firm and minerally. Brisk acidity highlights zesty lime, pear and white flower notes.",91,24,California,Calistoga,White Blend
"The 2009 vintage was a great one for this bottling, which was too sweet in 2008. This one's more like the '05, only richer and better. It feels nice and crisp and dry, with polished, complex citrus fruit, white flower, peach and mineral flavors.",91,22,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A beautiful Riesling, among the best in California. It's crisp in acidity, and despite low alcohol, is rich in flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, peaches and the distinct petrol note of the variety. Should age for a long time.",91,22,California,Oak Knoll District,Riesling
"Intensely aromatic of honey, wildflowers and juicy, sweet tangerines, this is a gorgeously complex icewine that balances richness with concentrated flavor and a nervy acidity. Deep gold in color, this silky-smooth elixir carries mouthwatering notes of citrus, honey and flowers all the way through its super-long finish.",91,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Done in a style reminiscent of Chinon, this offers blood and rock aromas and compact, dark fruits. Streaks of cassis, berry and herb are annotated with green coffee accents. There is a high-toned lift that helps to unwrap the flavors.",91,22,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Franc
"Available in half bottles, this pretty Pinot Noir is a block and barrel selection from the Cargasacchi Jalama Vineyard. It's elegant and classy, with polished red berry and spice flavors. Drink now.",91,20,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir
"Dark fruit flavors of cassis and black cherry, with supporting acids and firm tannins. Young and tight, this is well-made and driven by pure, clean fruit that has been aged in a mix of French, Hungarian and American oak.",91,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"This seems to be the first varietally designated Tempranillo from Gifford Hirlinger, and it shows exciting promise. Very little Tempranillo is planted in Washington, and most versions draw on the same vineyard sources; this is estate grown and therefore unique. Smoky and textural, it has a lovely depth of dark fruits and toasty barrel accents. The tannins are juxtaposed, and the match makes for a wine with tension and strength.",91,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tempranillo
"This deceptively named and priced wine is a gem. It's all estate-grown, and the blend is a fascinating combination of Merlot, Cabernet and Malbec, with a dollop of Tinta Cao, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot. Dark and demonstrative, it has a seductive nose of black fruits, toast and coffee. Currants and black cherries are wreathed in smoke, and the suppleness grows into a lengthy and satisfying finish. Many wines at twice the price would like to be this good.",91,16,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Red Blend
"From the Weinbau vineyard, a hot site on the Wahluke Slope, this ripe, chewy Cabernet Franc beautifully expresses a Washington take on the grape. The tannins are there in force, but all the rough edges are polished, and they are ripe with black olive and black tea flavors. Right behind is a solid core of cassis and blueberry fruit, streaked with iron and smoke. A very fine effort from an exciting new winery.",91,28,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Cabernet Franc
"Dark, thick and aromatic, this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah can stand alongside others selling for two or three times the price. It's a supple mix of dark fruits and spicy herb; it almost bristles with sharp hints of nettle, pepper and green tea. The tannins are supple and smooth, and there is a polish to the wine that extends into a smooth, seamless and very satisfying finish.",91,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend
"Holds its own in a tasting of Napa Cabs that cost, three, four, even five times as much. Made with a drop of Petite Sirah, it's dry, firmly tannic and complex, with black currant, beef jerky, miso, pepper spice and smoky oak flavors. Best now and for a couple years.",91,24,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This has been a successful bottling by Taz over the years, and they've kept the price steady. The '06 is very dry and complex, starting with an enormous burst of freshly crushed black peppercorn, then leading to a tannic mouthfeel framing blackberry, currant and violet flavors. Now through 2012.",91,28,California,Santa Maria Valley,Syrah
"Spicy, minty and sharp, this has a Sancerre-like edge, but with an extra weight to the fruit that is more reminiscent of like a South African Sauvignon Blanc. It's packed with green pea, herb, lemon and lots of citrusy flavors, all set against very sharp, bright but delicious natural acids.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"A pure Syrah from estate fruit, this dark, peppery, earthy wine is saturated with color and ripe fruit flavor. From the Yakima Valley estate, it buttresses the currant and cherry fruit with polished tannins that add many layers of depth and nuances of earth and smoke. The extra bottle time (this is the current release) has also helped to smooth out the rough edges. As the estate vineyard ages and the vines mature, these wines are gaining in both strength and detail.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"A very good Chardonnay-based sparkler, dry and rich in vanilla, peach and lime flavors, with exotic notes of grilled pineapple and fresh brioche. Feels clean and delicious, and should develop for a few years.",90,28,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Sparkling Blend
"A lovely wine, rich and balanced and crisp, that shows how sometimes an offbeat blend can be better than a varietal wine. Made from Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Viognier, it's deliciously off-dry. Each variety brings something to the table, resulting in a whole that's superior to its parts.",91,26,California,Napa Valley,White Blend
"A really good Sauvignon Blanc, so easy to drink, yet complex and elegant as well. Fully dry, it shows intricate flavors of citrus fruits, green apples, gooseberries and tangy minerals, with a long, spicy finish. Terrific example of how well this white variety flourishes in Dry Creek Valley.",90,18,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A wonderfully inviting nose leads into a juicy young Malbec that's packed with fresh raspberry and blueberry fruit, and accented with scents of pine needle and spicy, gin-soaked orange peel. The acid and fruit impact is immediate and powerful; the tannins almost silky. The finish gracefully extends the pleasure.",91,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Malbec
"Go elsewhere if you're looking for a big, oaky Chardonnay fruit bomb. This one is controlled and elegant, offering tantalizing hints of pineapples, minerals, sweet cream, buttered toast and spices. The acidity is mouthwatering. An elegant, food-friendly wine at a good price.",91,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"With touches of honeycomb and Granny Smith apple, this delightfully lush blend of 51% Chardonnay and 49% Sémillon from Livermore, partially barrel fermented in oak, is a creamy, medium-bodied white wine that would pair magically with shellfish or a warm goat cheese salad. A real steal at the price, too, and a fun bottle to expose to friends.",91,16,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay-Semillon
"A lovely wine, rendered with panache. Bright fruit flavors mix citrus, apricot, peach and pear. There's a winning smoothness across the palate, and a lively kick to the finish. Hints of lemon, tea, honey and candied orange all run right on into the finish.",91,18,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"A lovely Viognier that shows the variety's exotic richness while maintaining dryness and elegance despite high alcohol. The tropical fruit, wildflower, spice and honey flavors are deliciously balanced with crisp acidity.",90,16,California,Santa Maria Valley,Viognier
"A very nice Chardonnay with plenty of oak character that enriches the dry, ripe tropical fruit and white peach flavors. Likeable now for its clean crispness and elegance.",90,18,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"Made from Pinot Noir, this is a dry, crisply elegant and full-bodied bubbly. You'll detect a sweetly ripe, mashed red cherry background to the yeast and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2010.",90,28,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Sparkling Blend
"Sharp, tight, herbal and dense; this is a young wine that needs breathing time. The balance is perfect, with beautiful notes of spice and peppery herb; the fruit is tight and tart, a mix of wild berry and bramble.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"This excellent Riesling proves that the 2006 Stone's Throw Vineyard was no fluke. Heather Neff is a winemaker who understands the grape, and seems to be out in front exploring the possibilities for Riesling in Washington's emerging Lake Chelan wine region. Fragrant with honeycomb, beeswax and a mix of citrus blossoms, this lively wine is rich without being tiring, off-dry but not sweet or sugary, and delicately balanced through an extended finish.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Wow. What a super Riesling at an everyday price. Shows a brilliant crispness and minerality that scours and cleanses the mouth, followed by savory citrus, green apple, spice, wildflower and honey flavors. But the finish is totally dry.",90,12,California,Monterey,Riesling
"Effusively fruity, forward and luscious, this over-the-top Viognier is a bowlful of fruit salad. You name it, it's here —citrus, stone and tropical fruits in generous abundance. Backed by moderate acids, the wine is just this side of flabby, so drink up and enjoy it at its youthful best. What elevates the winemaking is the (apparent) use of new oak, which adds cinnamon, coffee and sweet spice at the back.",90,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"Rich, ripe and round, this lush take on Roussanne is loaded with cantaloupe, sweet pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit flavors. The fruit is brought forward by a small amount of residual sugar, which seems like an enhancement in this instance. The finish has just a hint of honey cough drop—sweet and slightly minty.",90,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Roussanne
"If Syrah can be elegant, this is the poster child. Dark and saturated, this wine is nonetheless light and almost airy, in a good way. The fruit flavors (berries and plums) seem to float above a bed of acid and ripe tannins. There are light streaks of iron and coffee and nuances and suggestions of rock and earth. The grapes are from Fielding Hills' Riverbend Vineyard—if you like those wines, you will surely like this as well.",90,27,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah
"There's no oak at all on this savory young Sauvignon Blanc, which delivers its richness directly to the palate, undiluted. Those flavors are of green fruits: melons, apples, limes and the slightly sour, flowery tang of gooseberries. Fine acidity makes it all brisk and mouthwatering. An outstanding Sauvignon Blanc for today's ethnic fare, at a great price.",90,14,California,Mendocino,Sauvignon Blanc
"Shows the exotically ripe flavors of Calera's Viogniers, with apricots, tangerines and pears. But also incredibly sweet in honey, with a very high residual sugar content. Drink this creamy, full-bodied dessert wine with vanilla-flavored desserts and white and yellow fruits.",90,24,California,Central Coast,Viognier
"Pretty much a successful repeat of the winery's '09. It's dry and high in acidity, giving it a zesty, clean mouthfeel. The flavors are refreshing, of citrus fruits, pears, vanilla and white pepper. A compelling and beautiful cocktail-style wine.",90,20,California,Edna Valley,Grüner Veltliner
"Lots of elegance and sophistication in this drily tannic, smooth Cabernet. It's textbook Napa, with complex blackberry and currant flavors, touched by smoky oak. A very nice restaurant wine to drink now, and easy to find, with more than 16,000 cases produced.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"John Kinney is doing great things with Livermore Valley fruit, most especially with many of his whites, including this classically oaked Fumé Blanc, the grapes barrel-fermented in 100% French oak (Seguin Moreau and Taransaud) and left sur lie for six months, Montrachet style. Creamy but bright with aromatics of caramel and vanilla, but only 50 cases were made.",90,24,California,Livermore Valley,Fumé Blanc
"The new vintage of this ever-popular blend is 39% Mourvèdre, 19% Counoise, 17% Syrah, 16% Grenache, 6% Cinsault, and 3% Carignan. What a compelling nose! A rich mix of tar, berry, smoke, earth and graphite opens into a broad and inviting wine with all of the above, splayed out across the palate and finished with a lick of bright acidity.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Rhône-style Red Blend
"Small amounts of Petit Verdot, Carmenère and Cab Franc in the blend make for a lively, intriguing Cab with a mix of earth, herb and berry aromas. Tart berry/cherry fruit gives a puckery mouthfeel; and Asian spices (from a variety of barrel sources) add more interest to the finish.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the first varietal bottling, though Malbec has been part of the winery's Claret blend for some time. Complex, tight, balanced and full, it carries a strong tobacco and vanilla streak along with the black cherry fruit that runs through the middle. The fruit is sappy and firm, also displaying cranberry and rosewater notes, black berry and coffee liqueur.",90,22,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Malbec
"With crisp acidity, a bright, creamy texture and rich flavors of lemons, limes, tangerines, peaches, pears and honeysuckle, this is a delightful white wine. Dry, yet with a sweet, spicy finish it's perfect as a cocktail sipper.",90,18,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Gris
"The vineyard, planted in 2003, is located on the Oregon side of the Columbia River. The young vines bring bright, effusive fruit flavors of raspberries and strawberry pastry, black cherries and plums. Aromatically there are whiffs of violets and spun sugar. All in all a most inviting, fruit-driven Malbec.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec
"A sort of advance peek at the Chardonnay that, in a year or so, will bear the Sleepy Hollow designation. It should be an amazingly rich wine, as even this junior version is. Dry, crisp and oaky, it explodes with pineapple, mango, apricot and buttered toast flavors.",90,23,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc, dry and crisp and low in alcohol. With no oak to interfere, it shows vibrant citrus fruit, guava, lemongrass and mineral flavors, balanced with zesty acidity. A beautiful, racy wine.",90,18,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This was picked at the same time as the regular Viognier, but fermentation was stopped, leaving it as a sweet wine (about 4.8% r.s.). The fruit is laced with honey, lime and apricot; it's delicious without being cloying.",90,27,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"Mostly old vine (mid-1970s) Riesling, this has 11.7% alcohol and about 1% residual sugar. This is a gorgeous bottle, with floral fragrances that pile on acacia, rose petals and citrus blossom, and then moves into a luscious midpalate loaded with apples, peaches and citrus. The wine is seamless and well defined, with a perfect mix of fruit-forward flavors and the cut and precision of an ageworthy, German-style Kabinett.",90,8,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"This potent Merlot has a rich, lush and complex bouquet that suggests a wine of considerable depth. In the mouth it shows black cherry, some smoke, leaf and well-integrated tannins. Rare indeed is the pure Merlot from anywhere at this price that can show this much concentration.",90,18,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
"Delicious. Although it's packed with tropical fruit and vanilla honey flavors, the finish is thoroughly dry, and an undergirding of minerals accentuates the crispness. Only 91 cases produced.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Great price for a wine this clean, bone dry and savory, not to mention complex. It has a solid structure, with crisp acidity framing gooseberry, Meyer lemon, lime and vanilla flavors. A fantastic food wine that sommeliers should leap on.",90,18,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Full of violet, flowery aromas that descend into oak, blackberry and cigar, this is a muscular Tempranillo with a feminine side, big yet smooth with subtle blueberry sweetness. Grown from the Rolleri Vineyard above Angels Camp and given 18 months of barrel age, this would make a spectacular pairing with wintertime roasts and stews.",90,22,California,Calaveras County,Tempranillo
"Zinfandel is not usually a wine you have to age, but this one does need four years or so in the cellar. It's bone dry and quite good, with classic wild berry, tobacco, grilled meat and spice flavors, but it's pretty tannic. Has the depth and balance to blossom by, say, 2015.",90,27,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
"Sebastiani has had good results with their Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, and this bottling continues that tradition. It's a lovely wine, dry and rich, with raspberry and cherry pie, sweet, smoky oak and spice flavors, brightened with fine acidity. A wonderful wine for restaurants at a price that's affordable.",90,18,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"This is 62% Tempranillo (Sugarloaf vineyard) and 38% Malbec (Two Coyote vineyard). A whiff of pipe tobacco leads into a mother lode of black cherry, introducing a lush palate of mixed purple and black fruits, with interesting herbal highlights extending right into the finish. Full and fruity, with flashes of spice and herb lighting it up like fireworks in the night sky.",90,29,Washington,Yakima Valley,Tempranillo-Malbec
"This is the first Riesling that Cor has sourced from this important Columbia Gorge vineyard, and it's a gem. Forceful petrol and pine scents lead a powerful, high- acid Riesling that offers citrus rind and tart fruits. Not a floral style; this packs a punch. Very Germanic and fresh.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Gorge (WA),Riesling
"Grenache takes the lead position in this dusty, salmon-colored rosé. It looks and tastes French, and has been given a bit more bottle age than most domestic rosés. Fruits run from wild strawberry and watermelon to light citrus, woven together and set against rather firm tannins. A substantial wine with real grip and depth.",90,23,Washington,Yakima Valley,Rosé
"A blend of Marsanne, Chardonnay and Roussanne, this is bright, fruity, with an emphasis on the rind rather than the flesh of citrus and stone fruits. A streak of vanilla runs through the core, and the finish has some stiff, tannic edges. Well-crafted, and a superb food wine.",90,15,Washington,Yakima Valley,White Blend
"Clean and well-ripened fruit holds down center court here; tart and tight flavors of currant and berry. It's wrapped in a shell of tannin that is still hard and seeming to hold the wine back. The best guess is to give it some bottle age and let it breathe, and you will be rewarded with a polished and expressive wine.",90,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Petite Verdot
"Fruit was sourced from the Doc Stewart vineyard, one of the region's oldest, and fermented in American oak. Bright gold in color, it opens with rich scents of buttered nuts, stone fruits, and dusty spices. You will find a lot of flavor for the price, and the wine retains sufficient acidity to brighten up the finish with a lick of minerality.",90,21,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Chardonnay
"Pure Merlot, though not labeled as such, this is broadly fruity with a play of strawberry, hard cherry candy, and citrus. The grape sources—Champoux, Klipsun and Bacchus vineyards— are impeccable. Tannins are stiff enough to put a stop to the finish, and to suggest that some further bottle age is called for.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"The coolness of the region and vintage shows in this Chard's acidic crispness and minerality. It comes down on the Chablis-style end of the spectrum, with hints of tropical fruits, apples and pears, as well as a welcome touch of sweet oak. Easily Silverado's best Chardonnay in years.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"A very bright, tropical Sémillon from Amador-based Andis. Winemaker Mark McKenna uses 35-year-old vines to make this layered, slightly sweet but completely in balance wine. Enjoyable lychee, just-ripe pineapple and fig permeate; the wine gets even better as it opens.",90,19,California,Amador County,Sémillon
"Lots of sweet raspberry and cherry fruit in this easy-to-drink Pinot Noir. It's nice and silky, with a spicy finish. Nice with grilled tuna, lamb or beef, and a good value for the price.",90,14,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Quite a fancy Sauvignon Blanc, from the four-sided bottle to the purity of citrus fruit, gooseberry and spice flavors. The richness is brightened by crisp acidity, braced with a stony minerality. Great with chicken, veal and pork dishes, as well as a spectrum of Mexican, Vietnamese or Indian fare.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Considerably lighter in body and texture than your average Cab Franc, Biltmore's 2009 has the weight of a nice Pinot Noir. But it's intense in cherry, red plum and cedar flavors, with ultrafine tannins. Sophisticated and elegant, a wine to drink with upscale fare, especially with mushrooms.",90,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Franc
"They packed a lot of flavor into this wine, then let it age for five years before releasing. It offers plenty of pleasure, at a great everyday price. Soft and round, its flavors are of blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar. Just delicious.",90,14,California,Lodi,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry and tough in tannins, yet impressive for balance and integrity. Shows currant, blackberry and smoky flavors, with a firm minerality. One of the better, more elegant Sangioveses out there.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Sangiovese
"From the Solano County Green Valley appellation just off San Pablo Bay comes this crowd-pleasing Syrah, a juicy, masculinely beefy and big version of the varietal with well-honed hints of baked bread, mocha and espresso.",90,24,California,Solano County,Syrah
"One of the best Pinot Noirs at this price you can buy. It's silky, light in body and enormously pleasurable to drink, showing brisk flavors of raspberries, cola, spices and toast.",90,22,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir
"Made from 100% Sangiovese, grown on the shores of Lake Chelan, one of Washington's newest and smallest AVAs. The extra year in bottle has softened and opened the aromas, which bring exceptional complexity to what might appear to be a more simple wine. Not just fruity, though there is plenty of tangy strawberry nectar, along with hints of orange peel and chai tea. The complexity here is remarkable.",90,22,Washington,Lake Chelan,Rosé
"A good, tight, plummy Washington Syrah. The fruit is showcased amid a fascinating smorgasbord of unusual (but Syrah-like) flavors: iron filings, iodine, clove, coffee, a splash of citrus. Complex, young and packed with flavor.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Grapefruit and gooseberry scents and flavors mark this as a New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc, and a very good one at that. The acidity carries the fruit, and brings a zesty freshness to the finish. Some suggestions of stone and spice liven it up. All stainless, and 100% varietal.",90,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"Pure varietal, with alcohol around 13.5%—typical for Robert Karl reds. Smooth entry, rich fruit and excellent structure. Bright cherry flavors dominate, gliding smoothly through a pretty midpalate into the tannins. The tannins just barely hint at an herbal underpinning, but are plenty ripe.",90,22,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Merlot
"This is half Tempranillo, one quarter Garnacha, one quarter Monastrell. Pop the cork and right away come aromas with a mix of exotic, seductive spices, vanilla, sweet grain, plum and some bakery sweetness. The fruit is plump and dotted with dried herb, dusted with powdered sugar, open and expansive.",90,19,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend
"The first Boushey vineyard Roussanne from McCrea includes a 25% portion of Grenache Blanc. The wine is sharp and high-toned, with a bit of burn to the finish. The fruit flavors dance around the fringes of tropical, with a softer melon core. Though barrel fermented in neutral oak, some tasty, toasty flavors abound.",90,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Roussanne
"Heavy, tannic and dense now, but clearly well-grown, this Bordeaux blend wants a little time in the cellar to knit together. An unusual blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot, it's rich and captivating in black currants and cassis, with a long, spicy finish. Shows masterful blending talent, combining grapes from the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. Hold until after 2012.",90,28,California,Sonoma County,Red Blend
"A dry wine, companion to the winery's off-dry estate bottling. This does not give up its fruit as some dry Rieslings do; there is a pleasing mix of lemon, grapefruit, pineapple and apricot, full in the mid-palate, then turning more astringent and cheerily tart in the finish. This is very young, compact, and still tight as a drum; it could be cellared for up to a decade.",94,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"This gorgeous new release, from a young winery with a Riesling focus, is resplendent with an enticing mix of flowers, fruits and stone. The scents well up from the glass and the flavors fill the mouth with a lively zest, pulling together streaks of lemon, lime, nectarine and apricot, accented with citrus rind and wet rock, honey and lemon tea.",93,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine. It should continue to evolve and improve from 2024–2034.",95,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Run, don't walk, to find this amazingly priced Cabernet. It's so good and rich, it easily holds its own against Cabs costing five times as much. Dry and smooth in tannins, it offers a burst of blackberry, black cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors, with a wonderful coating of oak. Drink now–2013.",93,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sought-after vineyard grower Charles Heintz has teamed with stellar Sonoma County winemaker Hugh Chappelle (Lynmar, Quivira) to make this divine estate-grown Rosé, pale pink in the glass with hugely inviting floral aromatics. From there is a bolt of electricity, the wine juicy and alive in peach, citrus and strawberry, mouthwatering and light.",93,19,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"Just under 10 g/L residual sugar, this Riesling, sourced from vines planted in 1972, opens with a juicy mix of grapefruit, orange and tangerine fruit. Textural and dense, it carries across and through the palate into a lingering, mineral-drenched finish. Superb already, it could be cellared through 2024 or longer.",93,24,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
"Bright and spicy, this is Pinot Gris with a bit of the grassy bite of a Loire Valley Sauvignon Blanc. Racy and loaded with grapefruit and pineapple flavors, this lingers lazily through a refreshing, acid-driven finish that invites further sipping.",92,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"This fancy, opulent Chardonnay is made in a certain Santa Rita style of high alcohol, which makes it enormously rich. It oozes pineapple, pear and lime jam fruit, while new oak adds buttered toast flavors and the glycerine from 15.5% alcohol makes the wine even creamier and sweeter. This is an inaugural vintage from the winery.",92,29,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"A fine bottle, fresh and fruity, with cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit in abundance. It's got depth and vitality, a youthful verve that promises fine ageability. Aged in 28% new French oak, it is just barely kissed with toast and mocha. A wonderful value.",92,26,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait.",92,28,California,Red Hills Lake County,G-S-M
"Just when this Chard seems simple and sweet, the fruit is overtaken by acidity and minerality, taking the tangerine, lime and mango flavors to the next level and making the wine complex and fascinating. Shows how exceptional winemaking can result in exceptional wine.",92,19,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods.",91,20,California,Lodi,Syrah
"Some Chardonnays with this much oak and lees influence lose all sense of terroir, but not this one. Somehow, vintner Bill Cooper has allowed the fruit to express itself, showing up as minerals, papayas and apricots. It's balanced and compelling. The price makes it a bargain.",92,29,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
"A stunner of a rosé, this wine's pale pink hue does little to indicate its action-packed reality. Nectarine, wet stone, and bubble gum occupy the aroma profile, but the flavors are what set it off. Ruby red grapefruit, strawberry shortcake, and a slight lemon chiffon element hammer home this beauty by Sta. Rita Hills-based superstar producer Kris Curran, formerly of both Sea Smoke and Foley. This is versatile enough to handle both seared scallops and grilled babyback pork ribs.",92,18,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache
"This is a Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre blend, with a trace of Viognier. It's a big, rich, voluptuous wine, dynamic in berries and vanilla cream from oak, and the acidity must come from that 2% of Viognier. So fruity, it's almost sweet, except that it finishes with a dry flourish. Only 960 cases were produced.",91,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Rhône-style Red Blend
"Boundary Breaks has proven to be the break-out producer of the Finger Lakes this year with an excellent line up of wines, and this off-dry wine is amongst its best. Elegantly perfumed with notes of fresh green florals and herbs, it builds in power and expression on the palate with pristine white peach flavors pierced with lime acidity and a reverberating mineral finish.",92,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This is a classically light rosé, fragrant in strawberry and raspberry. Traces of pomegranate on the back palate offers darker, riper fruit in the glass, getting prettier as it goes along. Deliciously dry and dancing in acidity, it has plenty of citrus on the finish. The wine is substantial enough for springtime and summertime meals, but will drink equally well on its own.",92,20,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Akin to a fresh basket of strawberries picked up at the farmer's market, this Grenache Rosé is intensely floral and fruity. A touch of blood orange peeks through, along with a flirty herbal streak and dry, soft textures. Light and bright, it offers a slight effervescence.",92,26,California,Mendocino,Rosé
"The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosé should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros.",92,18,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"Sadly, it's the last vintage for this single-vineyard Chardonnay. It captures the subtle blend of yellow and green berries and apples, with superior length and detail. Delicately nuanced barrel flavors bring in hazelnut and cookie characteristics. This has the exceptional acidity to age, despite going through complete malolactic fermentation.",92,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
"A home run. Given extra bottle age, this is drinking optimally at the moment, with a spicy, brambly nose mixing blackberries, mint and chocolate-covered cherries. There's a scent of fresh cut wood also, and a mouthful of fruit and barrel flavors that are both nicely integrated and complementary. The long finish lingers into a resonant note of black tea.",91,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir
"Cabernet from Oakville for under $20? Yes, and it's a really good one. It's dry and full bodied and rich in classic blackberries and cassis. How Kirkland sells it so inexpensively is a mystery. Classically structured, even ageworthy. Drink now–2015.",91,19,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Like it says, this Riesling is bone dry. It's also crisp in acidity, with a tang of minerals and steel. It gains richness from a rich core of lemon, lime and orange citrus flavors, and possesses that note of diesel that a fine, cool climate Riesling shows. Should develop over the next six years.",91,22,California,Oak Knoll District,Riesling
"Balanced and fresh, with a mix of pear, quince, melon and apple, lightly dusted with baking spices, this appealing Pinot Gris is a fine match for salmon, halibut, and other Northwest seafood. Textural, laced with refreshing minerality, and persistent into a long finish, this is Oregon PG at its best.",91,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Impressive for the price, because it's enormously rich, which makes it absolutely delicious to drink now. It's clean and crisp in acidity, with opulent flavors of tropical fruits, vanilla layer cake, buttered toast, Meyer lemon sorbet and honey. That makes it sound sweet, but it's thoroughly and properly dry.",92,28,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Tranche does an excellent job with this grape; here the palate-filling flavors are round and fleshy, with peach and pear fruit. Short-term neutral-barrel aging has further smoothed out the mouthfeel, and it finishes delightfully with just a hint of butter.",92,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Pinot Gris
"The color of a vibrant sunset, it's composed of 55% Grenache, 39% Mourvèdre, and 6% Cinsault. The lush and layered fruit flavors move from ripe summer strawberries into a mineral-drenched fruit salad.",91,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Rosé
"This full-bodied blend of grapes from a wide assortment of top vineyards shows fine acidity, a good phenolic frame of citrus rind, and core flavors of lemon and grapefruit, green apple and white peach. There's a seam of butterscotch also, from aging in one-third new French Burgundian oak barrels.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"While dry in style, this wine is chock full of ripe, rich yellow peach flavor accented with hints of dusty, floral potpourri and mineral tones. Its bold, expansive mouthfeel is penetrating on the palate, but cut with a line of lime acidity that lingers long on the finish. Delicious now, but its sharp edges and dark mineral tones should meld beautifully from 2019–2021.",91,29,New York,Seneca Lake,Riesling
"Made from a blend of 62% Grenache and 38% Syrah, this is a classically dry, refreshingly crisp rosé, pink-salmon in color that's intense yet soft, crafted in a Provence style. The grapes come from Rutherford, Atlas Peak and Sonoma County's Kick Ranch, tasting of fresh raspberry and spring flowers, a bite of wet stone on the finish.",91,22,California,Napa Valley,Rosé
"This is a fluid, fruit-laden, well-balanced blend. Spicy and herbal purple fruits are highlighted with cayenne pepper, chocolate and a pleasing hint of violets.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"For years, Foxen has been producing one of the best Chenin Blancs in California, and with this 2009, they have outdone themselves. It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs. Although production was only 575 cases, this wine is worth a special search, especially for sommeliers.",93,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chenin Blanc
"A beautiful Chardonnay, solidly in the Gainey style of balance and integrity, but also showing the cool climate terroir of its origins as well as the excellence of the vintage. The result is this crisp, richly oaked but balanced young wine. It brims with tropical fruits and spices.",92,25,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"A beautiful wine, crisp and elegant, filled with varietal complexity. Oak-inspired butterscotch and vanilla custard accent ripe fruit flavors of grilled pineapples and ripe kiwi, with a long, spicy finish. Beautiful now and for a year or two.",92,27,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"The best Chardonnays from this warm Sonoma County valley show tropical fruit flavors and are quite decadent, and this is one of the best. With crisp acidity, it brims with pineapple crème brûlée, papaya and vanilla custard. Drink this opulent wine with rich fare, such as scallops, crab and lobster.",92,24,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
"It's lush, leesy and rich, and broadcasts a flavorful mix of grapefruit, orange peel, Meyer lemon, hints of pineapple, Key lime pie and peach, all in a very creamy style. The wine is graceful and smooth, the fruit detailed with hints of toasted almond and cracker.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"A rich, woody style of Pinot Blanc, the barrel toast wrapped around superripe tropical fruit flavors of banana, papaya and pineapple, with a hint of grapefruity acids. This is flat-out delicious, and could easily pass for an expensive Chardonnay.",91,22,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Pinot Blanc
"Citrus and honeydew fruit flavors anchor this unoaked Chardonnay. It has a wonderful leesy texture that enlivens the palate, giving the impression of limestone, or at least lime pulp. Flavors linger, clean and utterly refreshing.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",90,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"This estate-bottled Pinot Gris, from a vineyard planted in 1983, shows some definite residual sugar, despite its alcohol rating of 14.4%. Plenty ripe all right, and plenty tasty, too. This has the body and balance to match up with a fat cut of salmon, perhaps in a semisweet tamari sauce, or a grilled pork roast with a fruit dressing.",90,16,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Pinot Gris
"This gentle, lightly off-dry Riesling was fermented primarily in neutral oak, which seems to have softened the entry without impacting the flavors. Aromatic highlights of honeysuckle and orange marmalade introduce a full palate with a complex fruit mix including raspberry, citrus and orange. The finish brings an impression of cotton candy.",90,19,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Riesling
"This wine immediately wows the palate, bursting into full flavor with an explosion of apple and pear fruit. There's a light yeastiness as well, just enough to suggest a young, fresh, exuberant wine, and it simply grabs hold of your taste buds and never lets go.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
"Viognier is half the blend, with the rest Roussanne and Riesling, yielding a delightfully aromatic, lightly honeyed wine, with a lush array of ripe fruits. Apricot, papaya, pineapple and banana are all here, with supporting acidity. Overall, this is one of the most delicious and unique white wines in Washington.",91,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,White Blend
"Chard freaks will love this California-style version of the variety. It's wonderfully fruity, with ripe pineapples, tangerines and papayas, and a rich, sweet taste, like bananas sautéed in butter and drizzled with honey. The acidity is perfect. Great job for the price, and easy to find, with production of 12,700 cases.",91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"The crown jewel of the winery's ice-style wines, it's gorgeously aromatic with notes of tropical mango and pineapple adorned with honey and blossoms. Dripping with nectar and yellow peach preserves, it's lusciously sweet, yet impeccably balanced with acidity and an elegant mineral tone that lingers on the finish.",91,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This is a great price for a single-vineyard Syrah from the Napa Valley region of Yountville. The wine is bone dry, acidic and tannic, with deep, impressive blackberry, black currant, green tea, charred meat and black pepper flavors. It improves a lot with decanting, and overall is impressive.",91,18,California,Yountville,Syrah
"Smooth and palate-coating, it's 100% varietal, with just the right balance between blackberry and black cherry fruit, and barrel-induced flavors of toffee, toasted macadamia nuts, and café crème.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Perfumed and elegant, this wine is a highlight within the producer's line up of consistently well-made wines. Waxy honeycomb and floral aromas accent fresh green notes on this off-dry Riesling. It's lean in style, yet plush with sweet white peach and melon flavors. Finishes long with a lingering spray of honeysuckle.",91,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Smooth and palate-coating, it's 100% varietal, with just the right balance between blackberry and black cherry fruit, and barrel-induced flavors of toffee, toasted macadamia nuts, and café crème.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Perfumed and elegant, this wine is a highlight within the producer's line up of consistently well-made wines. Waxy honeycomb and floral aromas accent fresh green notes on this off-dry Riesling. It's lean in style, yet plush with sweet white peach and melon flavors. Finishes long with a lingering spray of honeysuckle.",91,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This tangy, all-stainless, lightly grassy, dry Sauvignon Blanc is a pure and definitive elaboration of the grape's varietal character. Penetrating and crisp, it would be hard to ask for more from a $9 wine.",91,9,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"This satiny, slightly waxy Viognier is a blend from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Olsen fruit; for the first time, roughly 10% was fermented in a concrete egg. Aromatic with yellow apples, lemon curd, bee pollen and floral highlights, it's underscored with a lick of wet stone.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"Barrel-fermented and aged sur lie for 10 months, this elegant Chardonnay offers immaculate scents and flavors of lemon rind and pith, a dusting of spice, and a generous slice of ripe apple. It's full and luscious in the mouth, with appealing texture, barrel toast and just a pat of butter in the finish.",91,23,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Hints of lanolin and beeswax lend a luxurious slick to this delicately framed yet remarkably complex medium-sweet wine. White peach and pineapple flavors are luscious and ripe, but pierced with a streak of lime acidity and steely minerality. It finishes long with a swathe of fresh green herbs and lime zest.",91,25,New York,Seneca Lake,Riesling
"All Roussanne from the Gunkel vineyard, this is a fine expression of pure varietal fruit. A fresh and delicious blend of flavors, it touches on peach, apricot, lemon curd and pineapple, with impressive concentration through a long, clean finish.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Roussanne
"Up there in the Chalone hills they have a lot of limestone, and you can taste the flint and chalk in this wine even through the lavish tropical fruit and spice. It's a really interesting Chardonnay that's quite fancy and elegantly structured, and it will hold for a good six years.",92,26,California,Chalone,Chardonnay
"This is truly dry, yet quite flavorful. There's great texture in the mouth, which the winemaker attributes to the quality of the fruit. The acidity is natural, refreshing and succulent; the citrus flavors conjure up lemon, lime and grapefruit, with a pleasing roundness in the center palate. Long and clean, this is simply outstanding.",92,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"A lovely, complex Pinot that shows much of the flair of Byron's more expensive bottlings. The wine is dry and crisp and elegant, with long, deep flavors of currants, cola, sweet leather and dusty Asian spices. Good now, and will develop for at least six years.",92,28,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir
"Made from Grenache Blanc and Viognier, this pretty and enormously likeable white wine was barrel fermented. It has pleasant flavors of citrus fruits, raspberries, vanilla, white pepper, buttered toast and sandalwood. The finish is clean and zesty.",90,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Rhône-style White Blend
"Made in a lighter style, this Pinot comes from the cooler Napa side of the Carneros. It's light- to medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture and pleasant flavors of cherries, exotic dusty spices and sandalwood. Elegant and moderate in alcohol, it's a wine to drink now.",90,24,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir
"A very pleasant Chardonnay that's lifted above the ordinary by a brisk, dry minerality. Orange, lemon and pear fruit stars, with a suggestion of toast and complicated notes of anise, vanilla and cream.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"This varietally correct Sauvignon Blanc is clean, crisp and refreshing, with plenty of honey, pineapple and green apple, and yet has some meat on its bones, with a rich mouthfeel that belies its all-stainless-steel aging. It also has just a touch (2%) of Sémillon.",90,15,California,Livermore Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"As in past vintages, this is half DuBrul and half Meek vineyard fruit. It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot—this is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock. It strikes me as more typical of Malbec. The tannins are firm and dense, and the fruits are black as coal and laced with tar and smoke.",93,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
"A fine Otis Cab, from Columbia's now departed winemaking team of David Lake and Robert Takahashi. It's rich and deep, scented with a luscious mix of fresh herbs. The fruit has a pleasing spiciness, sweet plum and cassis threaded with anise and sage. There seems to be more fruit concentration and less of the green, peppery character that Otis can bring in some vintages, but even now this is a very young wine (it was released in June of 2008) that should reward another few years of cellaring.",91,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a big, ripe, distinctly New World Merlot that shows off its terroir to perfection. A long, sunny growing season has given explosive currant, blackberry jam and mocha flavors, while cool nights have preserved vital acidity and firm tannins. Drink now, with grilled steak topped with a blue cheese and brown butter sauce.",91,27,California,Mendocino Ridge,Merlot
"This comes from a one-acre block of Dijon 75 clone Chardonnay; whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented. Succulent is the word that keeps cropping up as it rollicks across the palate; it's juicy and loaded with a mix of apple, pear and light tropical fruit, especially pineapple. Bright and tangy, this nicely spiced wine continues the consistent quality streak for this winery's Chardonnays, and finishes with a lingering kiss of toast and cinnamon.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Always one of Napa's best Fumé (Sauvignon) Blancs, Mondavi's basic bottling is so good, it tastes like it has some grapes from the famed Tokalon Vineyard. It's a rich, pure wine, brimming with gooseberry, fig, green melon and white pepper flavors, accented with zesty acidity. Great food wine, and a bargain at this price.",91,20,California,Napa Valley,Fumé Blanc
"Whiffs of herbs and green florals persist from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush with ripe white-peach flavor, but blossomy and bright with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long with a delicately lacy sweetness.",91,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"The floral spray and sweet nectar of fresh yellow cherries persist from start to finish on this penetrating semi-sweet wine. It's rich and ripe with stone fruit flavors, but balanced with tart lime acidity and steely, honed minerality.",91,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This is a carefully made, almost calculated wine that showcases controlled herbaceousness around tight, crisp black fruits. The mix evokes earth, herb, barrel and grape.",91,23,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Still quite compact with youthful tension and energy, this will reward your patience. Dense flavors of raspberry, boysenberry and cassis are streaked with espresso and dark chocolate. The length is impressive.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Wölffer's dusty pink Grandioso has a saline minerality on the nose, accenting whiffs of raspberry and peach. As with the producer's standard-bottle rosé, the palate is crisp with acidity, but more intensely concentrated with juicy white peach and yellow cherry flavors. The elegant finish carries a touch of cherry blossom perfume.",91,29,New York,Long Island,Rosé
"This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red.",91,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Yellow peaches, waxy white florals and honeysuckle perfume this intensely aromatic wine. Floral notes persist on the palate as well, but are elegantly balanced with soft mineral tones and an invigorating lime acidity. Distinctly elegant, it finishes with a lingering hint of tea leaves.",90,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"A fine, appealing and complex wine, Redhawk's estate bottling shows more concentration than its less expensive stablemates, with nuances of bloody meat and mint that give it an almost Rhônish character. The alcohol is under 14%, and it drinks like a Burgundy, only with beefier tannins.",90,22,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Noir
"This is the kind of Chardonnay that divides wine lovers into enemy camps. Old World purists will criticize the candied richness. New World fans will love the toasted marshmallow, caramel corn and buttered toast flavors that rest on a solid foundation of pineapple and green apple fruit.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crème brûlée. Elegant and impressive for drinking now.",90,27,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"Good value in a solid Napa Valley Cabernet blend with plenty of upscale character. It's dry and firm in tannins, with complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, herbs and cedar. Drink now.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Meritage
"Dark yellow honey in color, this fine blend of 52% Sémillon, 48% Sauvignon Blanc is a nice ode to white Bordeaux, very French in its austerity, with plenty of creaminess and barrel richness, too. Its layers of lemon, peach, honeysuckle and butterscotch unveil themselves slowly, the wine's depth opening over time.",90,22,California,Livermore Valley,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"A fascinating wine. Tastes sweet and finishes bone dry, offering rich, tangerine and honey flavors, accented with crisp acidity. Nice as a cocktail sipper, and will play well with Asian fare.",90,13,California,Anderson Valley,Edelzwicker
"No winery in California has explored this French variety more than Cambiata, and with the '06, they've produced another interesting wine. It has weight and body and tannins, with wild black and red berry, currant, cherry liqueur, Provençal herb, tobacco and roasted meat flavors that finish with sweetness, although the wine is totally dry.",92,28,California,Monterey,Tannat
"The word inky must have been invented for this pure Cabernet Franc, sourced from the Weinbau vineyard (the label is misprinted). In the world of Cabernet Franc, many are called, and few are chosen. This is one of the chosen. Dense, tightly threaded with smoke, earth, black olive, black cherry, cassis and mocha scents and flavors, this nonetheless drinks smoothly. The tannin management is superb, softening up the hard edges without stripping the wine of flavor.",92,29,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Cabernet Franc
"Smooth and supple, this Helix Syrah is consistent with past efforts. There's more than a trace of herb and earth, plenty of acid and some tannins with more than a hint of compost and green tea. But for all that earthiness the wine has grip and concentration, with fruit that seems natural and honest. Don't look for jam or sweet preserves; this is more to the gamy, herbal side of the grape, but beautifully balanced.",91,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Fragrant and expressive, it's got a wonderful lift to the plummy fruit which is spiced up with clove and gamy scents of smoked and cured meats. This is not your typical jammy, fruit-driven Syrah; it's much tighter and more Rhône-like, with fine natural acids and aging potential of up to a decade.",91,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Our first sampling of the eponymous wines from winemaker Kelby James Russell is remarkably promising. Perfumed with rose petal and fresh cherry aromas, this Cabernet Franc rosé is lush yet easy drinking with juicy red-fruit flavor. Dry in style, it's elegantly framed with a bristle of astringency on the finish.",90,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Rosé
"From 100-plus-year-old Carignane vines, with splashes of Grenache, too, this is a refreshing wine for spring and summer. Stony in grapefruit and peach, it's balanced, light and dry with a fruity kick.",90,18,California,Lodi,Rosé
"Plum and especially blueberry fruit compels your interest immediately. It's cloaked in precisely focused tannins that frame an extended, lightly chocolaty finish.",90,23,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Exuberant raspberry and cherry notes scent this dusty pink rosé. While brisk and dry on the palate, it's juicy and mouth-quenching with ripe white peach and red berry flavors. It finishes minerally with lingering salinity.",90,19,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Rosé
"Notes of fresh herbs and melon rind lend a verdant tone to this semi-sweet, late-harvest wine. The palate is crisp with tart green apple and peach flavors, but imbued with touches of exotic orange spice and honey that linger mysteriously on the finish.",90,22,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Green herb and crisp apple notes lend a refreshing kick to pretty white floral and honeydew flavors in this brisk, intensely concentrated wine. It's semi-dry in style with a delicate, honeyed sweetness that lingers.",90,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Ripe cherry and luscious watermelon aromas waft from this summery, fresh wine. It's dry on the palate but concentrated, with bright cherry and berry flavors. Round and lush yet briskly balanced, it's a great summer quaffer at a fantastic price.",90,14,New York,Finger Lakes,Pinot Noir
"A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare. It's very fruity, offering a burst of raspberries and cherries, together with a coat of sweet, smoky oak. But crisp acidity and smooth, silky tannins provide a balanced structure.",90,17,California,Monterey County,Pinot Noir
"Estate grown, crisp and nicely defined, with a pretty mix of apple, pear, peach and apricot flavors. The fruit is framed with citrus rind (orange and grapefruit) and keeps the wine tight and focused through a clean, lingering finish.",90,24,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Gris
"Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling.",90,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"Believe me, you won't miss the oak barrel influence on this wine. It's so good all by itself. Brightened with crisp Monterey acidity and totally dry, it's rich in pineapple, tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, mineral and vanilla flavors that will satisfy your Chardonnay tooth.",90,16,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
"There aren't too many Sauvignon Blancs from Carneros, but judging from this beauty, the grape thrives there. In the right hands, of course. This one's from great vineyards, including Truchard's. It's a magnificent wine in the white Bordeaux style, rich and lush in mineral-laden gooseberry, honeysuckle, white peach, Asian pear and lemongrass flavors, with a vibrant edge of tangy pepper spice.",93,22,California,Carneros,Sauvignon Blanc
"A wonderful red wine, full-bodied, dry and elegant. It shows Cabernet character in the blackberries, cherries and black currants, but that's balanced with an earthiness and minerality and even some smoked meat notes that must come from a percentage of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Tasted in a flight of much more expensive Cabs, this one easily stood out. Drink now–2011.",92,16,California,Mendocino-Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows the weight, complexity and sheer deliciousness that this bottling almost always displays. Chardonnay fans will love the oaky, creamy flavors of pineapple tart, pear and lemon jam and buttered toast. The winemaker recommends pairing with black cod, and if you have a Chinese restaurant that makes a good version of this honey and soy inspired dish, it will be heaven.",92,26,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
"This is a lovely Chardonnay, a super restaurant wine list bottle. Dry and creamy, it offers pleasantly rich pineapple, lime pie, green apple, exotic spice and buttered toast flavors, accented with crisp, clean acidity.",92,23,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"A Sauternes-style white dessert blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, and quite a good one. Shows sweet flavors of apricot jam, pineapples, vanilla crème brûlée and spices, with fine, crisp acidity for clean balance.",90,25,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"Aromatic and highly textural. The wine brings out a lot of citrus rind, tart stone fruits, and leesy texture. There's plenty of acid and hints of an underlying minerality with no hot alcohol burn. Just a little hint of stem in the tannins.",90,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"All Seven Hills vineyard grapes, this is 100% varietal. It's a very fine effort, displaying a smooth integration of red fruits (currant, berry, hints of hard cherry candy) that create a firm and bright core, with spice and grip. It resonates and builds to a sharp, spicy, well-defined finish.",90,29,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Carmenère
"A mix of vineyard sources accentuates the strawberry and cherry-preserve fruit flavors with dappled herb and earth. The effect is to add detail without mass, and it makes for a wine whose flavors belie its almost-15% alcohol. Sweet black-cherry fruit and a lick of espresso from the mix of barrels make this an exceptional Syrah for the price.",90,19,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"Young and spicy, with deeply-etched cranberry fruit flavors, limned with leafy herbal tannins. The core of fruit is pretty as can be, and the nicely-managed tannins wrap it in a perfect frame, while giving it added muscle. Another two or three years in the bottle will really bring this into focus.",90,25,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir
"A fine, bone-dry and minerally Sauvignon Blanc to enjoy with shellfish, grilled chicken or on its own as an appetizer. A touch of oak adds richness to the vibrant, acidic citrus fruit, lemongrass and green apple flavors.",90,19,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
"Vin d'été means “summer wine,” and this delicate Cabernet Franc would be the perfect companion to a balmy summer eve. It's unabashedly rustic in style, with touches of leafy herbs, clay and barnyard accentuating crisp black-cherry flavors. Brisk and sprightly on the palate, it finishes long, with a murmur of velvety tannins. Unusual and a bit mysterious, yet truly lovely.",90,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
"Opening scents of cracker and Asian pear roll into a concentrated, sophisticated effort that was half barrel-fermented. Tart citrus, apple and pear fruit is touched lightly with pretty spice.",90,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Now sourced from the estate vineyard on Red Mountain, this exceptional rosé includes portions of Counoise, Cinsault and Grenache. Though the pale, coppery pink shade suggests a light wine, this is fragrant and full-bodied, with salmonberry and strawberry fruit, light spice and excellent length.",90,16,Washington,Yakima Valley,Rosé
"Sourced entirely from the Olsen vineyard, macerated on the skins for six weeks, and aged 10 months in neutral oak, this “orange” wine is bone dry, with head-turning aromas of orange liqueur, rose petals and citrus peel. Sip it slightly chilled as a warm weather apéritif.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Hints of bramble accent bright raspberry and peach scents on this refreshingly dry rosé. Juicy and fresh on the palate, it balances intense cherry and wild strawberry flavors with a brisk, brash acidity that drives a long finish.",90,17,New York,Long Island,Rosé
"Made from 88% Grenache and 12% Viognier, this lilting wine abounds with dry, fruity and floral characteristics. Salmon-peach in color, it has texture and the requisite refreshment offered by its barely ripe strawberry and peach swathes. Although it delivers enough acidity and bite to pair with food, it might be hard to wait that long.",90,19,California,Yolo County,Grenache
"With the massive honeyed sweetness, this dessert wine is easy to enjoy, but it has more going for it than just that. There are also polished apricot, pineapple brûlée and vanilla custard flavors.",92,16,California,Santa Maria Valley,Viognier
"A deliciously compelling wine that shows how congenial the Santa Rita Hills can be for Sauvignon Blanc. With a touch of Chardonnay for added richness, the wine bursts with vanilla-scented pineapples, papayas and honey, and a smoky, pastry richness like Key lime pie. Don't chill this beauty too much.",92,22,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is estate grown, from a Lake Chelan winery in an emerging region. Riesling is clearly a strength, as this has a delicate elegance often missing from the fruit bombs that can be grown in warmer sites. Bone dry, dusty and lightly floral in the nose. The balance of blossom, yellow fruits, juicy acidity and wet rock is impeccable; the wine extends itself gracefully into a lingering finish.",92,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Aromatically forward and lush, this greets you with lemon polish, beeswax, Satsuma oranges, and Key lime, backed with barrel-influenced coconut flavors. The flavors meld together in the mouth, holding firm with extra phenolic density through a lip-smacking, luscious and lingering finish.",92,21,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"Earns a high score for sheer richness and decadance. Huge in blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, bacon, pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into big, velvety tannins. Impresses for its size, but is totally dry, and retains balance and elegance. Now–2015.",92,25,California,Paso Robles,Syrah
"Ironstone's reserve Cab is getting better and better, the result of attention to detail. The 2005, held back for three years before release, remains a toughly tannic wine, but it's dry, balanced and elegant and contains a rich core of berry-currant fruit. Should develop for the next six years.",90,25,California,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Always estate grown and 100% varietal, Beresan makes one of the best Sémillons in the state. Exceptionally dry and crisp, this again suggests sweet grain, citrus and light tropical fruits. Notes of lemon oil and even a hint of diesel come in as subtleties. Though not as full-bodied and rich as the 2006, it's an excellent, well-made bottle, more in the style of a Bordeaux blanc.",90,18,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sémillon
"Tight and quite dry, this mixes dried herbs with wild blackberry and boysenberry fruit flavors. The ample acidity underscores just-ripe-enough tannins; but overall what most impresses is the wine's balance, tension and length.",90,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"The historic Dr. Konstantin Frank winery has long been a source for consistent, well-priced wines in the Finger Lakes. Pretty on the nose, with delicate floral and stone-fruit aromas, it builds in intensity and power on the palate, with a crush of sweet-tart grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Hints of fresh herb, honeycomb and zippy lemon-lime acidity add nuance and balance to a long finish.",90,15,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Black cherry and plum run deep, dark and rich throughout this concentrated Merlot (blended with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot). Refreshingly brisk on the palate, it's nuanced with earthy hints of granite and bramble wood. It's bold and richly structured, yet impeccably balanced.",90,20,New York,Long Island,Merlot
"This elegant yet fun Pinot Noir-based rosé is characterized by a voluptuous body, a supple frame on which to affix the typically pleasing rosé scents and flavors of bubblegum and wild strawberry. The finish lingers, with sour apple warmth that recalls the last lick of a Jolly Rancher candy.",90,18,California,Monterey County,Rosé
"Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc fermented and aged in stainless steel tanks, this wine shows why Dry Creek Valley has achieved such a fine reputation with this variety. Totally dry and brisk in acidity, it has savory flavors of lemons and limes, passionfruit, gooseberries and white pepper. Awesome with Vietnamese, Ethiopian and Indian fare calling for white wine.",90,17,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"These vines were planted in 1984; they are dry-farmed with all-natural acids, most unusual for Washington State. So you have a beguiling mix of aromatic, lightly soapy, perfumed, floral scents, matched to exotic passion fruit and grapefruity citrus. There is a lot of acid here, and it's a young wine, but it has wonderful concentration and a full-throttle mix of perfume, fruit and flesh. The finish seems endless, and promises a long life ahead.",92,22,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Gewürztraminer
"A captivating Chard that shows impeccable balance, and the price is very good for this level of quality. The fruit is brilliantly ripe in green apple, kiwi, Asian pear and lime flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. A firm minerality undergirds the structure.",92,25,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"This bottling from EOS is almost always one of the most dependable and satisfying dessert wines in California, and the price is good compared to its peers. The '07 is a very good sweetie, a pace or two off the previous four vintages. But it offers rich, honeyed apricot, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors and is very sweet.",91,22,California,Paso Robles,Moscato
"Here's a polished Cab that's almost sweet in flavor, but it's actually a dry wine. Just oozes cherries, currants and raspberries, with a pastry richness that suggests a chocolate-covered nougat candy. Best now through 2011, and easy to find, with 51,000 cases produced.",91,27,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Morgan has been a real pioneer in the unoaked Chardonnay movement, and when the wine scores, it scores big. Consider this a run-scoring triple. It's totally dry, very acidic (officially, 7.13 g/L, for the statistically-minded) and austere, with a hard edge of minerals. What fruit there is suggests tart green apples and white nectarines. Believe me, you won't miss the oak.",91,22,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
"Almost all of California's best Viogniers are oaked, but not this one. As with Tangent's previous bottlings, it just shows that this particular wine doesn't need wood to be opulent and completely satisfying. With brisk, clean acidity, it displays complex citrus, white peach, green apple, wildflower and mineral flavors. What a wonderful wine, and a worthy followup to the sensational 2008.",92,17,California,Edna Valley,Viognier
"Most of this Sauvignon Blanc was tank fermented, but a portion received oak. That gives a welcome layer of smoky richness and vanilla to the beautiful, underlying Meyer lemon, lime, pear and green apple flavors that are so rich and mouthwateringly tart. A very drinkable, dry white wine.",91,14,California,Sonoma County,Fumé Blanc
"A worthy followup to the wonderful 2006. Shows equal concentration of blackberry, blueberry and licorice flavors, with a bacon and pepper savoriness that tantalizes. The structure is fine and firm, the finish dry and spicy. Drink now for sheer deliciousness.",91,16,California,Mendocino County,Syrah
"This pure varietal, single-vineyard, barrel-fermented wine perfectly captures the baseline flavors and qualities of the best Washington Sémillons. Complex and slightly high-toned, it brings ripe stone fruits, a hint of honeyed tea, impressive length and penetration, and a waxy, polished, lingering finish.",91,20,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Sémillon
"More elegant than powerful, this Cab is medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture. It has pleasant cherry, red currant, cola, violet, pepper and spice flavors, and is quite food-friendly for a Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now.",90,26,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A fine Sauvignon Blanc whose slight sweetness is completely balanced with crisp acidity. Satisfies for the richness of the grilled pineapple, green apple jam and white pepper flavors.",90,15,California,Red Hills Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
"Great price for a big, powerful red like this. Tough in tannins now, it shows classic flavors of currants, mocha, anise and pepper, and will develop over time. Classy and impressive.",90,9,California,Alexander Valley,Petite Sirah
"Good price for a Syrah of this quality. Edges past the ordinary into true elegant complexity with the smooth tannins and perfectly ripened flavors of black currants, oatmeal cookie, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper. Best now and through 2010.",90,20,California,Paso Robles,Syrah
"This pure varietal blend of Merlot opens fragrantly with scents of black raspberry, black cherry, plum and smoke. Very young, tight and firmly packed, it's a wine that is already showing finesse and a pleasing tension between the tart fruit and the toasty, mocha-flavored oak. Given time in the bottle, it may well prove to be one of the best-aging Beresan Merlots ever made.",90,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"The 2006 Zachary's Ladder is 65% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. Beautifully defined, sharp and tight. Still compact, dense, hard and young, but loaded with mixed flavors of black cherry, iron and rock. The tannins are tough and hard, the wine is firm and focused.",90,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"This lovely rosé is made from certified sustainable grapes of indeterminate variety. Slightly effervescent in tart cherry and mint, there's a textured, complex layering of strawberry and raspberry in the mix that makes the wine bright and refreshing.",90,15,California,Sonoma Mountain,Rosé
"Whiffs of smoke and herbs add complexity to this beautifully floral, fruity wine. Off-dry in style, it's richly concentrated with peach and apricot flavors that reverberate on the palate with bracing lime-toned acidity. The long finish has a bristle of lemon-zest astringency.",90,14,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"This remarkably balanced semi-dry wine is intensely aromatic, with scents of preserved yellow peaches, saffron and spice. Juicy and ripe in stone fruit flavor, it's unabashedly forward, yet piercing acidity and delicate mineral tones lend elegance and style. Finishes with a lingering kiss of honey.",90,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Made from 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, this rosé was made in the saignée method, cold fermented for six weeks, left sur lies and cold stored, producing an intense, structured wine thick in strawberry and raspberry flavor with just a hint of herbal amidst its complex layers.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Rosé
"What's so interesting about this wine is the savory minerality, racy acidity and extreme dryness that make it completely different from 99% of the Sauvignon Blancs in California. It's not without fruit. You'll find mouthwatering Meyer lemons, sweet Kaffir limes and spicy figs. Just beautiful, and a real sommelier's wine.",91,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Sometimes a reserve designation on a Chardonnay simply translates to excessive use of new oak; here it brings a rich abundance of fruit, along with a density and texture rarely found in domestic Chardonnays. This is a fruit salad of a wine, to be sure, running through a farmer's market's worth of peaches, apples, pears, apricots, bananas and more. But it also brings the butter, the butterscotch and the barrel toast, layered in and wrapped around the fruits so it has the richness of a banana split, and some of the creaminess as well.",91,26,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
"This is a classy Chardonnay. Grown 1,200 feet above Calistoga and fairly well-oaked in new barrels, it's rich and complex, with flavors of grilled tropical fruits and toasted meringue. The structure is greatly improved by a crisp, minerally edge of acidity.",91,27,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role. It's really an elegant wine and a great value at this price.",91,25,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A really nice, versatile white wine to have with everything from salad Nicoise to roast chicken and pork enchiladas. Crisply acidic and bone dry, it shows tasty lemon and lime flavors, lots of pepper and a hint of gooseberry.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter. The berry/cherry fruit flavors are woven into a tapestry of earth, herb and spice, smooth and detailed, and the wine has a mouth-pleasing seamless quality that invites another sip, and another.",91,26,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
"This is pure Chardonnay, from cool-climate sites, showing a lean, sculpted spine that both defines and expands the flavors. Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Kudos to Jorian Hill for crafting a rosé that's truly dry. It's a sophisticated, elegant blush wine with subtle raspberry, herb, rose petal, spice and mineral flavors, finished with a wonderfully clean scour of acidity. This Provençal blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre is one of the best rosés of the yearn and is reasonably priced.",91,18,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Rosé
"This is a sort of second tier wine from Talbott. It's a strongly flavored Chardonnay and extremely ripe, with pineapple jam, apricot-infused crème brûlée and sweet vanilla-butterscotch flavors. But for all the richness, it's crisp and bone dry. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases.",90,19,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
"This 35% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 16% Grenache, 15% Cinsault, 13% Counoise blend, finished in screwcap, is once again outstanding. This may be the best Subduction yet; bursting with gorgeous fruit mixing every kind of red and blue berry, with a vibrant and juicy mouthfeel that speaks volumes about the quality and clarity of the fruit. It does not have the herbal-animal aspects of the southern Rhône, nor should it. This is just pretty, expressive, bright and fresh fruit shown at its best.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Malbec may well be the next red grape to emerge as a star in Washington State, once the young vines have a few more vintages behind them. This is 100% varietal. Light and elegant, it's nicely detailed with a peppery, floral character and a welcome persistence. Take the best qualities of Beresan's Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah and mix them into a single, more delicate varietal, and you have this lovely Malbec, which glides along to a finish with chocolaty, satiny tannins.",90,29,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Malbec
"The Sundance blend in 2006 is two-thirds Merlot, the other third splits Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's what the winemaker modestly describes as his “leftovers,” but like the best leftovers it tastes great. It's wide open and broadly appealing, with sweet and soft fruit flavors of ripe berries, cherries and milk chocolate. Along with the ripe, fresh fruit are soft tannins and some pleasing streaks of coffee and licorice.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"This Syrah/Mourvèdre blend is a forward, bright and seamless expression of peppery berry fruit. Tart, smooth and accessible, it's backed with refreshing minerality and a dollop of cocoa.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Rhône-style Red Blend
"A beautiful wine, it shows exquisite control at balancing green, minty notes with richer flavors of apricots, Meyer lemons, vanilla and toast. The finish is dry and tart.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"It's rare to get a twenty buck Pinot Noir this good. The wine is dry, silky and elegant, almost faultless in its precision. With savory cherry, red licorice, cola and sandalwood flavors, it's not an ager, but a very pretty wine for drinking now.",90,20,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir
Notes of apple blossoms and lilacs lend a floral exuberance to this semi-sweet wine. It's fresh and invigorating on the palate with crisp pear and white peach flavors accented with herbs and sprightly acidity.,90,22,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Pretty honeysuckle and freesia notes lend a blossomy feel to this supple, impeccably balanced wine. Tart white peach, quince and pineapple flavors are juicy yet bracing on the palate. It ends briskly with a shower of crushed minerals.",90,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Pinot Gris
"The nose on this dry, medium-bodied wine is fairly neutral, with subdued aromas of lemon, lime and apple. On the palate, however, it's exuberantly floral with notes of orange blossom and white peaches accented with lime zest and acidity. Finishes long with reverberating mineral tones.",90,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Blended from various vineyards around the valley, this is a pretty, polished Cabernet for drinking now. Dry and softly tannic, it has lush, appealing black currant, black cherry jam, herb tea and smoky cedar flavors. It's fancy and a good value.",90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's an intense minerality throughout this dry, elegantly structured wine. It's boldly concentrated with yellow peach and quince flavors, yet chiseled with streaks of lime acidity, lanolin and steel. Finishes long with a fragrant spray of honeysuckle.",90,19,New York,Seneca Lake,Riesling
"Venturing into the orange side of the rosé color rainbow, this Mourvèdre-based wine—with 13% Grenache—brings melon, guava, pomelo and ripening banana to the nose, followed by papaya and watermelon once sipped. It's a revealing look at the potential of the overlooked Central Coast vineyards that winemaker Ian Brand diligently seeks out, both for his personal labels and the many for which he consults.",90,19,California,San Benito County,Mourvèdre
"The term dry Riesling is unregulated and somewhat difficult to determine; some sweeter styles can taste dry, while some dry wines, such as this, carry a touch of sweetness in the fruit flavors. Here the fruits mix kiwi, white peach and yellow plum; while there are following flavors of chamomile and lemon verbena, with suggestions of beeswax. Sophisticated and nicely structured.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"Marked by big, ripe, juicy blackberry, raspberry and currant fruit, this single-vineyard Syrah is saved from simplicity by two things. There are complex notes of bacon, sautéed mushrooms, black pepper and smoky oak, and the tannins are wonderfully rich and ripe. Really delicious. Probably best soon, though, before the fruit fades.",91,23,California,Dry Creek Valley,Syrah
"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), lined with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.",91,19,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"From a mix of Milbrandt vineyard sites, this outstanding blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Syrah, Malbec and Barbera. The blend was so well done that each component adds a vital piece to the whole—smooth berry and cherry fruits, spice, tobacco, licorice and smoke, folding into a lush and chocolaty finish.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"This is Zaca Mesa's basic Syrah, and it's quite a good wine. Dry and rich in tannins, it's showing complex flavors of black currants, black pepper, violets and cedar, with a meaty, leathery edge. Now through 2010.",90,22,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah
"Sourced from mature plantings in cool sites, this exemplary Riesling is technically off dry, but retains its apple-fresh snap and tang. The sweet/tart fruit flavors include abundant peaches, nectarines and apples, and the mouthfeel is ripe and full, the finish lingering.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Tamarack's Firehouse Red incorporates 12 different grapes in the blend, though most are in tiny percentages. Nonetheless the wine is focused and deep, with luscious boysenberry, licorice and dark chocolate flavors wrapping together in a complex and textural whole.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"As can happen with young wines like just-released rosé, a slight bit of effervescence is visible. The interesting smell of fermentation gives rise to strawberry and pink bubblegum scents. The gum persists on the palate, but in a pleasant, not overwhelming or sweet way, as does red licorice and watermelon.",90,16,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Rosé
"As reliable as the first flowers of spring, this perennial best-of-show winner offers lovely scents and flavors of fresh-picked strawberries. Subtle suggestions of rose water and orange peel can be found, along with some precise fruit-skin flavors.",90,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese
"Vibrant and fresh with hints of apple, green herbs and blossoms, this off-dry wine boasts a plush, juicy palate full of white peach and lime flavors. It's anchored by a clean line of steely minerality that lingers elegantly.",90,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
"Petite Verdot is a hard variety to succeed on its own, but Calcareous has produced a fine, dry wine made from that Bordeaux variety. It's full-bodied and complex, with flavors of currants, mushu plum sauce, violets, dark chocolate and anise. Such are the tannins that the wine should develop through 2010.",90,28,California,Paso Robles,Petit Verdot
"Made from vines planted in 1965, David Hill's estate Riesling is aromatic and textural, with an interesting, nuanced character that brings apples, peaches, pears and passion fruit flavors in profusion. Despite 1.8% residual sugar, it has plenty of acid and alcohol, finishing with a creamy, lemony fade.",90,14,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
"Duckhorn has been remarkably consistent with this bottling, although the price has crept up the last few years. The '07 is right up there, a sweetly oaked, leesy wine whose citrus and lemongrass flavors are fattened up with the pears and figs of Sémillon. The finish is quite dry and rich.",90,27,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"An impressive Cabernet, the winery's best effort in years. Dry and firm in tannins, it shows a Bordeaux-esque elegance and balance, with sage and cedar notes framing underlying red currant fruit. Now through 2012.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Scents of licorice, coffee and tobacco move into concentrated blueberry and cassis fruit flavors that wrap into a tannic, chewy midpalate. The fruit here is outstanding, and the wine delivers excellent, clean, concentrated flavors at this price point. An outstanding value.",91,20,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Red Blend
"A really nice, elegant Chardonnay at a good price. The wine is dry and lightly oaked, showing rich pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors enhanced with crisp acidity. Only 731 cases were produced of this lovely, food-friendly wine.",91,22,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"Tangent makes the best, most consistent unoaked Sauvignon Blanc in California. The 2009 is another classic, offering brilliantly clean, crisp flavors of citrus fruits, green apples and gooseberries. Just beautiful.",91,13,California,Edna Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a beautiful wine from the nose on out. Complex and aromatic, it has Italian-style tobacco scents, fresh acidity, leafy highlights, and undertones of tar, licorice and clove, all wrapped around tart, pie cherry fruit.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Blended with 17% Sauvignon Blanc, this lovely Sémillon is exceptionally fragrant, satiny and rich, with fleshy, ripe fruits and just a hint of toast. A warm streak of caramel enlivens the finish, which lingers gracefully and fills the palate with delicious flavors of apples and spicy pears.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"A very fine Viognier, one of the best of the vintage, that takes the variety's exotic, sometimes over-the-top richness and controls it with crisp coastal acidity and a deft touch of minerals. Elegant and interesting, it displays utterly dry flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, fig, date, honeysuckle, vanilla, spice and flint flavors. Drink now for freshness.",93,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Viognier
"Sourced about equally from Kiona (on Red Mountain) and Rosebud (in the Wahluke Slope), this deep, dark, well-made Syrah offers exception value. The fruit is plenty ripe, a mix of berries, raisins and plums; there is a generous chocolate note, firm tannins, and the grapes' earthy, lightly funky side displayed as well. It's all beautifully balanced.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Made with no oak, this pretty wine stars fresh fruit and clean acidity. With orange, honeysuckle, melon, mineral and vanilla flavors, it has a mouthfeel midway between a crisp Sauvignon Blanc and a creamy Chardonnay. Production was low, only 559 cases, but worth a search.",91,17,California,Edna Valley,Grenache Blanc
"A beautiful Syrah, richly textured and delicious. Held back for three years, it's perfect now for the soft texture, and the raspberry, cherry and orange zest flavors have a spicy edge. Complexity is enhanced with additions of Petite Sirah, Sangiovese, Barbera, Grenache and Viognier.",90,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Syrah
"This is exactly what Merlot should taste like, and you get it for a pretty nice price. Dry and velvety, it has immediately likeable flavors of red cherries, smoky bacon, violets, peppery spices and a lovely coat of sandalwood. Drink this lush, smooth wine now.",92,20,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"Consistent with previous vintages, this is barrel fermented in neutral oak, and opens with crisp and pure aromas of citrus skins, grapefruit and lime. The fruit flavors follow suit, intense and persistent.",92,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"A beautiful rosé bubbly, from the copper-salmon color to the final finish. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and refined, with complex orange, raspberry, vanilla cream, mineral and brioche flavors. Gains extra points for the smoothness of its bubbles.",90,27,California,Anderson Valley,Champagne Blend
"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% Sémillon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity. If it were not fermented dry, this would be a stunning late harvest dessert wine.",90,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"Wonderful aromatics, with suggestions of carpaccio, olive and violets. The tannins are ripe and polished, underlying glorious purple fruits, a panoply of berries and plums. It's still very young, but made with perfect texture and balance, and a little white chocolate in the finish.",92,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Crisply dry but very rich, even exotic, in fruit, this Chardonnay is a good value for the money. It's flamboyant in tropical pineapple jam, pears, vanilla custard and buttered toast, with a stony minerality.",92,26,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"Smith-Madrone makes one of California's best Alsatian-style Rieslings from their estate high up on this estate in the Mayacamas. It's a dry, crisply acidic wine, brimming with citrus, pear, diesel, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, and it's an ager, as vertical tastings prove. Beautiful now and through 2013.",92,25,California,Napa,Riesling
"Great price for a brut this classically structured. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's dry and crisp, with a fine mousse that gives it a creamy smooth mouthfeel. The pineapple, raspberry and vanilla flavors are delicious.",90,19,California,Mendocino County,Champagne Blend
"A very nice Chardonnay for this price. It's barrel fermented and aged on the lees in the classic style, which gives smoky, creamy notes to the underlying pineapple, green apple, Meyer lemon and orange flavors. Vibrant Carneros acidity makes for a clean finish. Easy to find, with 13,000 cases produced.",90,18,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"With this 2008, Taz brings to the table a wonderful Chardonnay at a great price. It's dry and crisply acidic, with bright, perky flavors of oranges, peaches, Meyer lemons and smoky vanilla. Really nice and clean, a lovely wine and a good restaurant by-the-glass selection. Production was 9,000 cases.",90,18,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"A surefire success in all the Milbrandt vineyard holdings, Syrah shows stuffing and spine here. It's firm, herbal and earthy, with a lightly funky aspect. But the fruit is there in support—black cherries and blackberries—and the hint of toast and mocha in the finish provides exactly the right send-off into the next sip.",90,25,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah
"You'll find beautiful, lush, complex, fruit-driven aromas here, as with all the L'Ecole white wines. This captures the complexity of the grape—rarely seen in domestic Chenin Blanc—ripe apples, spice, hints of honey and caramel, and a lovely, persistent floral overtone. In short, this is the Chenin Blanc that should be made, that can be made, and that is rarely made in this state.",90,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chenin Blanc
"Some high-toned floral highlights liven up the nose, and the sweet fruit shows blueberry and blackberry. Still stiff and tannic, it's edged with an earthy, herbal character highlighted with some sweet baking spices from the oak. Nice detail and good management of oak and tannins; this is a wine to study and savor.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet-Syrah
"McKinley Springs is showing a deft touch with its white wines. This one has absolutely lovely aromas of beeswax and honeysuckle, leading into lime and citrus on the palate. Long and refreshing, with no alcoholic burn despite its almost 15% alcohol.",91,14,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Viognier
"The Coéo bottling is a preview of the three single-vineyard Viogniers that will be released as the white wine half of the AlmaTerra project. It's a very promising beginning, juicy and citrus-laden, with lime and grapefruit, a refreshing hint of tonic water and a splash of sweet sun tea.",91,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"The cool-climate fruit provides the bracing aromas, the lively texture, the crispness without bitterness, and fruit that doesn't veer into overripe peach or apricot. It's got an edge to it, but it's very clean, stylish and polished, with a nice level of intensity that has no bitter, hot or volatile elements.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"Fruit-forward, spicy and appealing, this is consistent with previous editions of this popular wine. Since 2005 is a particularly good year, this has more concentration and fruit power than usual. The tight blackberry core, wrapped in leaf and showing a lot of earthy flavors is particularly attractive. The oak is folded into the wine; finishes with focus, purity and balance.",90,25,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah
"The cow catcher is the front of the train engine guard, and speaks to the railroad theme of this winery. An outstanding “second” wine, this value blend drinks like a much pricier wine. It's ready to go, with broad, softened, mixed red fruits, baking spices, toasty barrel notes and a smooth, gliding, lingering finish.",90,19,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Red Blend
"Malvasia is an aromatic variety, like Riesling or Muscat. This wine is bone dry and brims with mouth-cleansing acidity. Flavorwise, it's all oranges and tangerines, with hints of honeysuckle and white pepper. There's something tangy and layered that makes it terrifically interesting. Try as a refreshing alternative to tart wines, like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.",90,15,California,Monterey,Malvasia Bianca
"If you are looking for a right-on, pure and typical example of Washington Syrah, this is a good place to start. The fruit is deep and black, a mix of berries, plums and cassis, threaded with tobacco, earth and iron ore. Everything seems softened and smoothed, making this especially accessible, in part, most likely, due to this supremely balanced vintage.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Great price for a Pinot Noir this rich and fancy. It really flatters the palate, offering waves of raspberry, cherry, root beer, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, with a spicy finish. The light, silky texture is especially nice, as is the low alcohol balance.",90,19,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"A lovely Merlot, showing a French influence in its Bordeaux-like delicacy and earthiness. Feels elegant in the mouth, a supple, lightly oaked wine with layers of cherries, tobacco, cedar and sage. Good value.",91,26,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"The acids in white wines of the 2008 vintage are superb; and the beautiful match of acids and sugars in many Washington Rieslings is nicely displayed here. The aromas are ripe and rich with a nice mix of floral, apple, stone fruit and light tropical fruit. Flavors evolve with pleasingly sweet hints of honey and tea; this feels like a wine that could age beautifully.",91,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Aromatic and lively, with honeysuckle, peach, apricot, apple and cinnamon pear scents. It's delicate and complex in the mouth; bone dry and yet carries a lovely sensation of sweet blossom. Another very fine effort from this up and coming Chelan winery.",91,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Great price for a Zin of this purity and varietal truth. Dry and medium-bodied, but sweet in fruit, it shows wonderful flavors of wild forest blackberries, with complications from black pepper, orange peel, anise and Asian spices. The texture is sheer velvet. Best now and through 2010.",90,20,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
"A delicate, silky and sensual Pinot Noir that shows real value. Firmed and toned by racy acidity, it shows polished flavors of cherries, raspberries, sassafras, cola and cinnamon spice.",90,20,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir
"Sharp scents with a light hint of cardboard, piercing lemon oil and pineapple, minerality and lemon tea. The flavors follow, and the wine has good concentration and depth, with a dry, toasted cracker and wet stone finish. It gets better and better in the mouth.",90,14,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power.",96,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",95,26,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",95,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Starts with an opulent, inviting aroma of smoky honey, vanilla, tangerines, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots, green apples and minerals. In the mouth, the flavors are very similar—an explosion of fruits, spices and toast. Just a tremendous wine, but for all the volume and complexity, it's completely balanced.",94,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Smooth, seductive, toasty and rich on the nose, this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties is not a big wine, but drinking extremely well at the moment, with a precise balance of fruit, earth and barrel that sets up seductively in the mouth, and stays there. Excellent length and fullness.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A beautiful rosé sparkling wine, one that shows loads of finesse and elegance. But the final word is its deliciousness. Really captivates with subtle raspberry, toast, vanilla and yeasty brioche flavors that finish so crisp and clean.",90,27,California,North Coast,Sparkling Blend
"Pretty good price for a Cabernet this elegant and rich. Starmont is a kind of second label to the excellent producer, Merryvale, and this '07 shows a fine pedigree, as well as the general quality of the vintage. It's dry and balanced, with complex blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Drink now–2013.",90,27,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"McCrea's fifth varietal bottling of Mourvèdre is a blend of fruit from opposite ends of the Yakima valley AVA. Velvety and loaded with red fruits, this appealing wine also carries a hint of smoke and non-funky leather.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Mourvèdre
"Tangent is on the cutting edge of bone dry, crisply elegant and superbly fine white wines at everyday prices, and this bottling is among their best. It's wonderfully tart, with mouthwatering flavors of lemons and limes, Asian pears and minerals. A super value, and a sommelier alert.",90,13,California,Edna Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"It's lush and fragrant with sweet cherry and plum, truffle and smoke, moist earth and mocha. Surprisingly delicate in the mouth, and yet not shy with the flavors, which stack generously one upon the other, finishing with black olive and slightly bitter baker's chocolate.",90,28,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Cabernet Franc
"This is 100% varietal, all barrel fermented; it's sharp and spicy, with light citrus, balanced acids, and ripe melony fruit. Still quite young, it is already hinting at honey in the finish, and done in a crisp, moderate style (mid-13% alcohol).",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"A beautiful, lush Chardonnay, made in the ripe California style. Rich and creamy, marked with brisk acidity, it shows wonderful flavors of pineapples, roasted marshmallows, buttered toast and vanilla, with a tart, spicy scour of lime. Brilliant and complex. The vineyards were a combination of Sierra Madre and Bien Nacido.",94,23,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",93,24,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
"Making a balanced, delicious Petite Sirah is hard anywhere, much less in a hot place like Paso Robles, but Filice has risen to the challenge. The wine shows Pet's huge, lush blackberry, boysenberry, plum and coffee fruit, complexed with dark chocolate and seasoned with Asian spices. Yet it remains dry and elegant. This is really great Petite Sirah.",93,26,California,Paso Robles,Petite Sirah
"Rich, creamy and lush, this is right up to the very high standard set by the rest of Novelty Hill's white wines. It's rare to taste an American Chardonnay with this mix of exotically ripe fruit, baking spices and crisp natural acids. It just hits every base square on, and takes its time rounding third and heading for a home plate finish. A very impressive effort.",93,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Merryvale's '05 is very rich and balanced, and shows fine Napa Cabernet character in the intense focus of cassis, enriched with new French oak. It's not an ager, but showcases very high Napa quality for immediate drinking.",92,27,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a savory, delicious and varietally true Pinor Noir that drinks well right away, but has the structural integrity for the cellar. With crisp, dry flavors of cherries, pomegranates, cola, tobacco and Chinese five-spice, it appeals for its exotic immediacy, but has the density to evolve for 5 or 6 years.",92,28,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir
"100% Syrah from the same mix of vineyards as the 2005: Stone Valley, Les Collines and Va Piano. It's ripe enough to bring in brambly berry flavors, while retaining some herbal, peppery notes. Streaks of coffee and fresh-turned earth run through it, with excellent definition and balance.",90,24,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"The residual sugar is 2.5%, keeping the alcohol under 11%, and with the generous natural acids of the vintage it balances out just fine. Truly Germanic in style, it carries suggestions of sweet honey and tea, coupled with the snap of natural acids and a mix of pretty fruits.",90,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Flinty, with dense citrus rind phenolics, and great length. There are subtle traces of honey, lingering threads that suggest everything from apples to papaya.",93,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish.",93,20,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Chardonnay
"A very seductive nose with both power and flower in full array. The floral components are unusual and show exceptional winemaking talent. Very chocolaty, smooth, with the purity of cassis fruit and the power of fully ripe tannins to back up the barrel flavors. It fades gently into the finish, leaving behind that lovely chocolate and a trail of dark fruits.",93,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears.",91,28,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"In a sea of mediocre Merlots, Longboard's '06 stands out. It's not only deliciously ripe and generous in blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice, cola and mocha flavors, but the structure of fine acidity and smooth, elegant tannins makes it delectable.",91,24,California,Russian River Valley,Merlot
"Richly oaked, fantastically ripe in long hangtime fruit, this Chard has exotic flavors of golden mangoes, nectarines, passionfruit, pineapple jam and kiwis. Oak adds extra layers of buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky vanilla. For all the honeyed sweetness, it's totally dry, a tour de force that's at its best now.",91,22,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
"A fine Zinfandel, rich and briary, with wild forest flavors of black and blue berries, Asian spices, tangerine zest and smoky sandalwood. Full-bodied and dry, it's nice now and for the next few years.",90,18,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel
"This is deeply saturated, lush, scented with violets, raisins and chocolate, still tight and spicy. Excellent depth and structure, with about one quarter of the oak new. It needs some breathing time, and as it opens it shows more Rhône-like flavors of blood and shrubby herb.",90,29,Washington,Red Mountain,Syrah
"Violets, lovely and fragrant, leap from this broad, soft and open Merlot, loaded with beautiful sweet black fruit. The oak is showing a lot of toast now but that's not a criticism; this is really tasty, pleasing and a fine value.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"The Chelan region is Washington's newest AVA, but already showing great potential for Syrah, as this aromatic and explosively flavorful bottle proves. Ripe berries, plums and cherries are swept into a mix of smoke and rock and iron filings; as you taste through the wine there are citrusy acids and hints of resin and tar; it just keeps adding in the nuances.",90,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Very rich and extracted, and much more full-bodied than Sausal's “Family” Zin, with which it was co-released. This is one to cellar for a few years, to let things come together. Just massive in chocolate, berry jam and pepper spices, wrapped into firm, refined tannins.",92,24,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"This low-alcohol (10.4%) dessert wine, finished with 11% residual sugar, is absolutely spot-on. Layers of textural detail amplify the concentrated core of lemon drop and candied orange, and an orange pekoe tea character adds still more flavor interest through the finish.",92,19,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Sauvignon Blanc
"Iron Horse has one of the most consistent Viognier records in California, with a style all their own. From their mountain vineyard in Alexander Valley, the '06 shows tremendous balance, with an exciting tension between dry, minerally acidity and Viognier's exotic fruit and wildflower flavors. The wine was stainless-steel fermented and did not undergo malolactic fermentation, which helps account for the cleanliness.",92,26,California,Alexander Valley,Viognier
"This bottling continues to impress after all these years with its complexity and sheer deliciousness. The '06 shows charred barrel fermentation notes of pungent, smoky wood, but there's a great heart of citrus, melon and pepper spice flavors that makes the wine rich and rewarding. It's made even better by zesty acidity and a bone-dry finish.",91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Fumé Blanc
"Here's a vibrantly fruity, fresh young wine. It's light in texture and silky, with crisp, lip-smacking flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, cola, clove and cinnamon. Delicious now.",90,28,California,Edna Valley,Pinot Noir
"Opening with an enormous blast of black pepper, this wine shows a unique approach to Syrah. It's fully dry, with finely-honed tannins, and the blackberry and cherry flavors are joined with intriguing notes of ground beef, tamari, carob and violets. The vineyard is in the hills between central Mendocino and Anderson Valley, an area that probably deserves its own AVA.",90,22,California,Mendocino,Syrah
"This is really a lovely Zin. It has the weight, tannic structure and complexity of a fine Napa Cabernet, but the flavors are all Zinfandel. They include black pepper, red and black cherries and raspberries, currants, sweet tobacco, gingerbread and smoky oak influences.",90,18,California,Mendocino-Amador,Zinfandel
"A classic Washington tasting-room Riesling—only better. Opulent and fruity, with apricots, star anise, mint, a very nice spicy streak that lifts it up, and adds a lot of complexity. Smooth and supple, it coats the palate, captures some floral highlights, even a bit of marshmallow.",92,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Showing a zesty mix of lime, citrus rind and rock in the mouth, it's dense and still a bit hard, but deep. A rich, textural, serious Viognier, there's plenty of fruit and depth for near-term drinking, but it gives the definite impression that it needs more bottle age to fully blossom.",92,16,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Viognier
"This is a big, ripe, rich and oaky Chardonnay, the kind that will seduce lots of people with sheer dazzle, although only 135 cases were produced so it's likely to be hard to find. Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity.",92,28,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay
"Has great weight and texture, with an unctuous, oily mouthfeel, and is crisp and dry. Almost like a great Chablis, with a tang of steel and minerals undergirding the limes, pineapples and wildflowers. The grapes are from the well-regarded Sierra Madre Vineyard.",92,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"Thoroughly delicious. This captures a distinctive side of the grape that blends a sweet grassy herbaceousness with a lively mix of apple, lemongrass, citrus and orange peel, finished with the slightest suggestion of honey.",92,18,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Sauvignon Blanc
"A very fashionable Sauvignon Blanc. It takes the basic architecture of crisp acidity and dry, spicy citrus and fig fruit and boosts it to levels of true elegance and sophistication. Leaves a long, impressive finish that makes you want another sip.",92,27,California,Carneros,Sauvignon Blanc
"What a great Pinot Gris. Barrel-fermented, it shows a toasty, creamy smokiness to the citrus, nectarine, fig and vanilla flavors, with that Edna Valley acidity that's so clean and refreshing. Absolutely delicious, it's rich and substantial enough to stand in as an interesting alternative to Chardonnay.",90,24,California,Edna Valley,Pinot Gris
"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages. It's a fine, dry, acidic Chardonnay whose oak-infused lemon and lime flavors will complement sourdough bread and cracked crab.",90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
"Smooth, satiny, seductive and deep, this exciting debut from a new winery shows first-class fruit sourcing and winemaking. The berry and cassis fruit flavors are ripe and polished, balanced with firm acids and hints of black olive and black tea in the tannins. Beautifully defined and balanced throughout, this is crafted for aging, but delicious already.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Just beautiful, showing Alexander Valley Zin at its best. Dry and full-bodied, it's enormously flavorful in spicy wild berries, with a cherry liqueur smoothness. But it's not high in alcohol, and is thoroughly balanced and elegant.",92,19,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
"This wine hits the ground running, with a surging nose of ripe raspberries, cassis, coffee, tobacco and chocolate. Those flavors fall right into line in the mouth, the fruit so bright and fresh you can almost see it. Flavors are focused and penetrating; little details keep emerging throughout a lengthy finish. It's hard to believe this is a $15 wine.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"The Starmont designation is sort of a junior version of Merryvale's more expensive wines and is often a solid value. So it is with this Cab, whose grapes come from some prestigious vineyards. It's dry, rich and complex, with a classic Napa balance of firm, sweet tannins, acidity and cassis and cherry fruit. Beautiful now, and should hold well for six years.",91,27,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Showing Talley's distinctive elegance and brilliant structure, this Chard is a blend of the Rincon and Rosemary's vineyards. The wine's architecture really makes it special, with acidity and dusty tannins providing the bare bones to the lemon, lime, pineapple and mango fruit. A great wine to have with food.",90,26,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
"With no oak influence, this Sauvignon Blanc was cool-fermented, preserving fresh fruit, and it did not undergo malolactic fermentation, so that the acidity is brisk. It was aged on the lees. That is a great formula for keeping prices low while crafting a wine of creamy interest. With citrus, lemongrass, melon, fig and vanilla flavors, it's a stunning buy for this price.",90,14,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc
"Creamy smooth and enlivened with brisk acidity, this Chard shows forward, tart green apple, lime and pineapple flavors. Oak barrels add even richer notes of buttered toast and butterscotch to this elegant sipper.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Oriana blends Roussanne, Viognier and Riesling to good effect. This nicely evolved 2007 has a bouquet of lemon oil, citrus and hints of white blossom. The citrus flavors continue, buttressed by a strong mineral streak. It's drinking beautifully right now.",91,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend
"You have to look closely at the back label to see that this is sourced from the outstanding Boushey Vineyard in Washington's Yakima Valley. But there is no doubt once you taste the rush of blueberry/blackberry fruit, swathed in smoky meat, bacon fat, dried tobacco and composted earth flavors. Incense aromas weave through, with firm acids holding the wine in focus.",91,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Full-bodied, it leans into stone fruits and light tropical. Tasted a few weeks before its official release, it remained a little sugary, with its relatively high alcohol (and lower acidity) adding to the impression of sweetness.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Shows tremendeous richness and impressive weight along the lines of a Chardonnay, although the flavors are lighter and more refined, suggesting tangerines and Meyer lemons. Brisk coastal acidity provides brilliantly bright balance. Very fine as a more food-friendly alternative to many Chardonnays.",91,28,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Blanc
"From Tablas Creek cuttings, this outstanding Roussanne is intentionally picked early enough to preserve acidity, minerality and to keep the alcohol at a sensible level. Fragrant with acacia, white peach and pear, this elegant wine skips lightly across the palate, but has a density of flavor that carries well into the lingering finish.",91,22,Washington,Red Mountain,Roussanne
"The oak is sweet and upfront but well-proportioned to the size of the fruit in this luscious Chardonnay, which comes from a cooler part of Napa Valley. There's Carneros-like acidity and very ripe, forward pear, peach, pineapple and date nut bread flavors.",91,23,California,Yountville,Chardonnay
"This was fermented completely in stainless, and finished totally dry. Made from 12-year-old vines, it punches up the aromatics, and focuses on grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Good length and plenty of acid make it a crisp, food-friendly wine, and though it is not labeled dry, it tastes like it.",90,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Gewürztraminer
"As ripe as the fruit is, and it's very ripe, with showy blackberry, cassis, plum and mocha flavors, this Syrah is dry and balanced, with the acidity and tannic structure that comes from the terroir of this cool Monterey appellation. It's a very interesting wine, with real class and style.",90,29,California,Arroyo Seco,Syrah
"A very interesting wine that clearly shows its cool-climate origins, with a great big burst of brisk acidity that gets the tastebuds whistling. Underneath are pure flavors of green apples and ripe kiwis. The oak is sizable, but perfect for this formula, adding delicious honey, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. This is the best J. Lynne Chard I've had.",90,19,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"One of the palest rosés of the year in color, this blush isn't shy in flavor. It offers a sunburst of lemon chiffon pie, strawberry, raspberry and chutney flavors, and finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. This is a really excellent wine.",90,16,California,Russian River Valley,Rosé
"This Rhône-style picnic red is a blend of 47% Syrah, 29% Grenache, 12% Cinsault and 12% Mourvèdre. Scented with the spicy authority of the Syrah, the other grapes add meat and muscle and spread the flavors broadly out across the palate. It's got a good mix of smoke, spicy fruit, meat and sage. The name means “at the moment” and the moment is still a ways away, so air this one out.",90,28,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Red Blend
"This is all Birch Creek vineyard fruit, barrel fermented and put through full malolactic. It's soft, fleshy and buttery, with good ripe light tropical fruit, lots of barrel flavor, and enough acid to support it all. Both Rulo Chardonnays are perfect expressions of their style—one oaked, one unoaked—each in fine balance and proportion.",91,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Well-integrated flavors of mixed fruits are augmented with a sneaky streak of caramel, and a slight buttery softness in the finish. Very appealing, with a good long finish.",91,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"A very nice Chardonnay that's dry and crisp and elegant. Shows tart, leesy flavors of citrus fruits, apricots and pears, with a steely minerality that may come from those famous Livermore rocks. Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",90,15,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay
"A very nice red wine for drinking now with foods from all sorts of ethnicities and styles. Made from a bunch of varieties, including Cabernet, Grenache and Tempranillo, the wine is dry and tannic, with deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, anise and sweet, smoky sandalwood.",90,18,California,Sonoma-Napa,Red Blend
"Minerals, acidity and sweet green argula give a tangy tinge to the underlying citrus fruit in this dry, structured wine. Fans of big, fat Chards will find it austere, but those valuing elegance will call it Chablisian.",90,25,California,Mt. Harlan,Chardonnay
"With some Carneros fruit blended in, this Sonoma Coast Pinot is a very nice example of cool-climate Sonoma County Pinot Noir. It has good enough acidity to balance the rich, exotic cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate, tea and cinnamon clove flavors that are enriched with the vanilla and caramel of oak.",90,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir
"This is a very interesting rosé from just north of the Golden Gate. It smells as candy-jammy as a pack of LifeSavers, then turns acidically tart in the mouth, with bright, juicy flavors of fresh raspberries and cherries. Loads of fun on its own, or with bouillabaisse, baked ham, gravlax.",90,18,California,Marin County,Rosé
"Good, rich Zinfandel that brings a Napa elegance and sophistication to the variety's wild and woolly personality. The briary, brambly thing is all here, with wild berry, cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper flavors, and the exuberance is distinctively Zinny, but the wine has the body and balance of a fine Merlot.",90,17,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
"This is a complete switch from the 2004, which had no Syrah; here it is 60% of the blend. Very few wines in this price range have this degree of energy, detail and precision. The mix of fruit, spice, herb, rock, acid, barrel and tannin is delightful.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"This balanced Pinot is easy to like. Made in a lighter-bodied style, it's fragrant in red cherry, cola, tangerine and root beer. Finishes with a nice, food-friendly bite of acidity, and should hold well for several years.",90,28,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir
"Fragrant, inviting, this lovely Pinot Gris bursts out with fresh cut pear flavors so crisp you want to bite it rather than sip it. Lovely perfumed highlights of clover and sweet blossom add interest. There is just enough phenolic bite to give the finish further definition.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Pinot Gris
"Tight and vertical, this is veined with licorice, tobacco and vanilla, threading through the tart, wild mountain berry fruit. Smoke and black tea, with a whiff of barnyard, seep into the finish. Needs extra breathing time.",90,28,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Syrah
"Absolutely beautiful, one of the best unoaked Chardonnays on the market. Brims with bright, clean flavors of pineapples, limes and kiwis, along with vanilla and a touch of cinnamon spice. With its brisk scour of acidity, it's a super-drinkable wine.",90,16,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"The winery calls this a “trocken” style. It's aromatic with a mouthwatering juiciness (though not too puckery) that invites a second (and third) glass. The alcohol is a moderate 12.5%, making this a perfect summer all-purpose, all-food sipping wine.",90,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Concannon has an historic stake in Livermore Valley Petite Sirah, hence the name Conservancy, and with this wine, they do themselves, and it, credit. Dry and full-bodied, it's a peppery, tannic wine with satisfying blackberry and leather flavors. Will gradually unfold over many years.",90,15,California,Livermore Valley,Petite Sirah
"Shows lots of dryness and austerity, with acidity, minerals and herbs accompanying the citrus and oak flavors. Not a flamboyant Chardonnay, but a controlled one that offers complexity. A good companion to fresh crab, with buttery garlic bread.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"The promise is there in this ripe, plush wine, with its rich tannins and good acidity. It's rewarding in herb-tinged blackberry jam, plum, violet, coffee and chocolate flavors, with a distinct white pepper edge. As good as it is, the next step is to build in extra layers of complexity.",90,25,California,Red Hills Lake County,Syrah
"This is a mirror image of the winery's Riesling, which provides 10% of the blend. Fragrant rose petal and toasted nut aromas mingle, creating a sensuous effect. It's quite dry, fresh and youthful, capturing the intensity of Washington fruit and the elegance of an Alsatian Gewürztraminer. This should make an excellent cellar wine, but there's no reason it can't be enjoyed immediately.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Gewürztraminer
"As before, the new vintage of Chatter Creek Viognier treats you immediately to bracingly fresh scents of peach, apricot and ripe melon. Tart and leesy, immaculately clean, it starts with crisp, slightly bitter notes of lime and citrus, then fans out, adding a creamy texture to the mid-palate. This is a moderate 13.5% alcohol, rare in Washington Viognier.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"Young, tart and tannic, this blend will please those who like a tight, herbal, snappy, peppery, Washington take on Syrah. Tart and extremely young, yet satisfying and seductive, I believe this will age quite nicely for 6–8 years.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Dry, oaky and tart in citrus and tropical fruits, this Chard teeters on the edge of everyday drinkability and white tablecloth sophistication. The layers of buttercream, crème brûlée and vanilla custard tilt the balance toward elegance.",90,18,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
"This is quite consistent with the 2004 in terms of style, showing lots of vanilla-laced bourbon barrel, spice and buttered nuts in a tight, stylish frame. The alcohol is just over 14%; the wine is ripe, full, with a mix of citrus and green apple flavors, fresh, crisp and penetrating. It could age for another 5–6 years, as per a good village Burgundy.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Firm and full of fresh pear and apple and white peach fruit flavors. A clever blend that includes Muscat, Viognier and Riesling. Crisp and full-bodied, with a very clean and refreshing mouthfeel that extends into a bright, satisfying finish.",90,9,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Pinot Gris
"Plump and spicy, mixing mint and apple, with flavors running into riper fruits—pear and peach. This fills the mouth with luscious fruit, suggestions of vanilla cream and butterscotch, with just enough acidity to bolster it on through into the finish. It's big and thick for Riesling, yet beautifully balanced and quite delicious.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"We need wines like this that are super-dry, ultra-crisp in acidity and sleakly lean. This one's the anti-Chardonnay. It's tightly wound in minerals and citrus fruits, a Sancerre-style wine born to drink with food. Crab salad in lettuce wraps or chicken satay skewers come to mind.",90,16,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A beautiful Pinot Gris that lifts this variety beyond workhorse into true elegance and style. Braced with brisk acidity and minerals, it features rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, wildflowers, honeysuckle flowers, vanilla and cinnamon spice.",90,28,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Gris
"A bit overt in oak, with vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors dominating. But you'll also find rich, flamboyant notes of pineapples, kiwi fruit and limes. Fancy and elegant, with broad restaurant appeal.",90,28,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"Nice, smooth Zin, achieving a balance of ripeness and dryness. Shows the exuberance of Amador fruit, with blackberry, black cherry, licorice and mocha flavors that finish with a scour of briary tannins.",90,18,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
"Petite Sirah can handle high alcohol better than most California reds, and while this one is 15.7% and has a chili pepper heat, its inherent size makes it more or less balanced. The tannins are gigantic, and the fruit is enormous in blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and coffee flavors. Heat actually works as a seasoning, rather than a defect, in such a wine.",90,25,California,Redwood Valley,Petite Sirah
"Shows the bright acidity of Carneros, which seems even brighter this cool vintage. That accentuates the lush flavors of puréed pineapples, guavas, nectarines, butterscotch and honey, leading to a long, spicy, rewarding finish. Easy to find, with more than 16,000 cases produced.",90,19,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Dry and crisp, this Chard, which was 100% barrel fermented, has complex flavors of flowers, minerals and citrus fruits, with a rich vein of toasty oak. It's quite elegant and a great food wine. Easy to find, with 19,000 cases produced.",90,18,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"In this newest vintage of Oriana, the Riesling component has been bumped up to 18%; the rest is half Viognier, 31% Roussanne. The three grapes complement each other well; the Riesling adding aromatics, acidity and a barely perceptible amount of residual sugar. This opens with a vitamin pill aroma that slowly dissipates; the fruit flavors are a mix of pineapple and Satsuma orange, with lots of natural acidity.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend
"Made without oak, this wine stars its natural flavors without barrel interference. And what a nice wine it is, with racy acidity and a stony minerality undergirding ripe flavors of lime, pink grapefruit, kiwi, white peach, apricot, chamomile tea and wildflowers. Finishes clean, spicy and wonderfully dry.",90,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Viognier
"Stainless steel fermented, this pure varietal is bursting with a tasty fruit bowl mix of apple, pineapple, and Meyer lemon. A hint of mint sneaks in, and the acidity brings bracing minerality to the finish.",90,13,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Dark, tannic and full-bodied, this five grape Bordeaux blend from a classic Washington vintage is 100% Alder Ridge fruit. This is a fine effort, cellar-ready and substantial. Black fruits, fresh herbs, a hint of tomato leaf, a streak of caramel, all come together but need lots of breathing time (or cellaring) to show their best.",90,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This juicy blend of Gewürztraminer and Riesling sports a lush mix of melon, citrus, orange peel and grapefruit, with spicy highlights.",90,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend
"The Boomtown brand from Dusted Valley is quickly becoming one of Walla Walla's best value lineups. This smooth and satiny Cabernet was aged in 50% new oak—mostly French—and has the chocolaty mouthfeel to prove it. Round, ripe, tasty red fruits are set against the barrel flavors and a streak of licorice. A lot of wine for the price.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very rich and voluptuous, with a mouthfeel of pure satin and velvet. Rich and extracted, too, offering a wealth of blackberries, currants, chocolate and pepper. A very tasty wine for drinking soon.",90,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah
"Nice and balanced, an elegant Zin with classic flavors of wild cherries, cola, herbs and spices, with a delicate mouthfeel that finishes totally dry. A scour of dusty tannins gives it fine structure. Really notable for its silky purity.",90,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Shows the tangy minerality this cool appellation is known for. The pear, green apple, lime and kiwi fruit has a cold metal, almost chalky edge that lends this wine a Chablisian complexity. Bone dry and elegant, it should develop over the next five years.",90,27,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay
"Swanson deftly avoided green, unripe flavors in this cool vintage, although this wine flirts with them, offering a spearmint edge to the pineapple, peach, fig and honeysuckle flavors. It's really a delicious wine, dry and clean in acidity, with a long, racy finish.",90,21,California,Napa Valley,Pinot Grigio
"This has long been one of the best Sauvignon Blanc-Viognier blends in California, and the '06 continues that tradition. Coming from a cool vintage, it's very dry and racy, with a scour of acidity and stony, minerally flavors, with touches of citrus blossom and wildflower. No, it's not a fruit bomb, but it's a sleek, elegant wine, in the European tradition.",90,26,California,Alexander Valley,Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is not an ageable Cab, but it is balanced and complex, and has more than $20 worth of elegance. Dry and softly tannic, the Provençal herb, black cherry and oak flavors make you reach for a second glass.",90,20,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The winery does well with this wine, which once again seems to carry all the right stuff, a pleasing mix of lime and grapefruit, Meyer lemon and meringue, nuanced with ginger spice. Full and long-lasting, it is one of the richest Viogniers in the state.",90,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
"Inviting, fresh, racy scents mix pineapple, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is an interesting mouthfeel not unlike Sémillon, though none is indicated in the blend. The wine has substantial length and unusual highlights of spice, clove and mint, along with plenty of rich, ripe fruit to hold down the center palate. Not shy at 14.8% alcohol, this is a fine effort from consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Pure varietal, this estate-grown Malbec from Snipes Mountain (central Yakima Valley) is deep and fascinating, with luscious plum and berry flavors accented with floral highlights. It moves gracefully across the palate, showing subtle streaks of earth, iron and a tiny whiff of the barnyard.",90,28,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Malbec
"It's pretty chilly at Roche's Carneros vineyard, and this wine is not one of those superripe Syrahs. It shows a nice array of cherries and berries, but is also very peppery, with a fine note of grilled, charred beef on the bone. It's a complex, pleasing wine for drinking now with upscale fare.",90,26,California,Carneros,Syrah
"Good price for an upscale Chardonnay this rich and interesting. It's oaky, with vanilla and buttered toast flavors, but the underlying pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit easily supports the wood, while brisk, refreshing acidity provides balance.",90,22,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay
"A flamboyant Chardonnay. Shows flashy scents of vanilla and buttered toast from oak, riding high over pineapple, pear, golden mango and nectarine fruit. Crisp acidity provides needed balance to the richness. Good price for the quality.",90,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"This very limited (600 cases) companion to the winery's Ethos Chardonnay marks a turnaround for Ste. Michelle's red wine program, as Bob Bertheau came on board just before the 2003 crush. The style is seductive, sharp and spicy; the tart fruits tumble out in a pile of mixed berry and cherry. Chocolate and baking spices add more flavors; the wine is seamless, smooth and long; the oak beautifully integrated.",94,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"A superb follow-up to the winery's 2003 Milbrandt, it's the same 40/60 blend from Clifton and Sundance, both located in Washington's new Wahluke Slope AVA. A penetrating nose of cherries, violets, blueberries and black olives leads into a wine that masks its power with finesse. Licorice, tar and smoke wrap around the bright raspberry fruit core, with just a whiff of white pepper. Great winemaking, and a price point more wineries should emulate.",93,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"A full-on Bordeaux blend, with 61% Cab Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 11% Cab Franc and 9% Petit Verdot. Tight and slatey, it's got firm, hard—but certainly ripe—tannins wrapped around concentrated cassis and mulberry fruit. It's very well made but can use some softening up; a few more years will add to its complexity and develop its bouquet.",93,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Chardonnay rarely rises above the mundane, but when it does, you wonder why doesn't everyone make it like this? Big and voluptuous, this gorgeous bottling retains enough acid and balance to deliver the big-time goods with finesse. Silky, ripe, lush yet sculpted, it plays out deliciously through an extremely long and richly fruity palate.",93,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Youthful, plummy, bright, clear and very toasty. The new oak jumps out at you, but then the fruit stands up to it. It's hard and tannic, taut, compact, serious Cabernet, with plenty of stuffing for cellaring, and just a hint of leather and leaf.",92,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend
"A concentrated, young, satiny wine that mixes in 8% percent Grenache. Inky purple, it already is beginning to hint at developing layers of meat, smoke, tar and licorice, although the primary fruit flavors, sappy and concentrated, dominate. It's very young; give it plenty of air time.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"This is quite a delicious wine. It's not supersweet, and has long, deep flavors of ripe apricots, white chocolate and vanilla, with a crème brûlée richness that seems equal parts fruit and smoky oak. The acidity is keen, providing balancing relief to the sweetness. Fabulous with a butter cookie or shortbread and vanilla ice cream.",92,15,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Muscat
"I love this Chard for its bright, brisk acidity that fires up the palate, only to reward it with ripe, delicious flavors of Key lime pie, kiwi and pineapple. Oak adds notes of buttered toast and vanilla. The result is rich, refined and complex, a Chardonnay to linger over. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.",91,20,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"The combination of brisk acidity and perfectly ripened kiwi, tangerine and papaya fruit makes for one beautiful Chardonnay. Oak adds smoky, vanilla and buttered toast notes. The result is a captivating wine, rich and elegantly tailored.",91,26,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
"It's been cofermented with Viognier—instantly apparent in the spicy, citrus aromas that permeate the nose. An invigorating, lifted scent combines lemon and lime and orange peel with raspberry syrup and mocha, and that's before you even taste it. It continues in an elegant style, with lovely, interesting flavors that blend together seamlessly and never overpower the palate. Notes of pine, wild herb and smoked meat add interest through the finish.",91,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"The fleshy, fruity nose suggests very ripe, mixed berry and cherry fruits, and there is a liberal amount of oak. A good, open, broadly fruity mouthfeel knits the wine together nicely. In fact, its flavors seem woven throughout, mixing the fruit with notes of oak, bacon, smoke and ham. Surprisingly long.",91,13,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Tears of Dew has established itself as one of the leading white dessert wines in California, and the '05 is nobly in that tradition, although it's not quite up to the astonishing opulence of '04. Very sweet and well acidified, it has delicious apricot liqueur, orange marmalade and vanilla cream flavors and a long, complex finish. Just gorgeous.",93,22,California,Paso Robles,Moscato
"Poet's Leap was the first wine to be released under the Long Shadows portfolio, and this 2005 is clearly its best yet. Old-vine Riesling from Dionysus and Weinbau form the core of the wine, which is immaculate, rich and generous. The fruits sound like a county fair in summer—melon, stone fruits, citrus, honey—and the mix of residual sugar (about 1.6%) and racy acids is thrillingly on target.",93,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Roughly half Cab, half Merlot with a splash of Cab Franc, this excellent Bordeaux blend comes on with well-ripened fruit, pretty cherry flavors accented with barrel notes of kahlùa, espresso and smoke. Concentrated and smooth throughout, it is the star of this new winery's first lineup of wines.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The first Merlot in the winery's 15-year history is restrained, aromatic and lightly leafy, showing hints of tobacco under the pretty, soft, plum and berry fruit. Just the right amount of smooth, chocolaty tannins follow through; the wine is ripe, yet not too ripe. A pleasing spiciness comes out as it breathes.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"Another beautiful wine from Gainey, a great producer whose Sauvignon Blanc comes from one of the best terroirs for that variety in California. The aroma is so invitingly rich in lemongrass, pineapple zest, Key lime pie and coconut macaroon that you almost fear it won't follow up in the mouth, but it does. Bone dry, rich, zesty and clean, it seems to have benefited from the coolness of the vintage, in the way the beautifully ripe fruit is accented by crisp, flinty acidity. This is gorgeous, world-class Sauvignon Blanc.",93,20,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
". If you're familiar with the lush, complex Chards from Robert Young, this will ring a bell. It's layered in ripe mango, guava, nectarine, peach and smoky, caramelized oak flavors, with an exotic taste of butter-sautéed bananas. All that flavor is nicely balanced by rich, lemony acidity.",92,23,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
"From a 1,700-foot vineyard high above the valley comes this compellingly delicious Zinfandel. A word of caution: The alcohol is 16.6%. But the wine isn't at all hot, and high alcohol is the price you pay for the lush, ripe fruitiness achieved in this scorching vintage. Brims with cherries, blackberries, raspberries, chocolate and spice, finishing long and dry.",92,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"This is Sauvignon Blanc with a 14% blast of Viognier; the combination is vivid and bracing, like a dash through a cold mountain spring. All stainless, no malolactic. It's cool as ice, clear and leesy, and the tart fruit is edged with citrus rind flavors, a nice mix of orange, lemon and lime.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"Great mouth presence, built upon stylish, racy fruit. It's tangy and spicy and handles the 100% new French oak with ease. Sappy and loaded with bright, tart red fruit flavors, this is a really pleasurable wine. Unfortunately, just 25 cases were made.",91,23,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"The vineyard is an old one with a proud name, and the winemaker does it justice in crafting this dry, balanced wine. It's Zin all the way, with wild berry, cocoa and spice flavors and rich tannins that contribute to the lush, soft mouthfeel. Earns extra points for the sheer exuberance of its varietal personality.",91,25,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
"Very smooth, bright and juicy, it's got a nice mix of berries and chocolate, cassis and coffee. This has a zippy, tart edge to it, almost racy, but there are plenty of substantial tannins holding up the finish. Big, stylish and strong.",91,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"This 75-25 blend shows interesting bacon fat aromas and a lot of sweet cinnamon spice. The blend really works, as the Viognier adds lift and precision to the Chardonnay, which softens and smoothes out the Viognier's rough edges.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay-Viognier
"Aromatic, rich and dry, this wine was fermented in used Chardonnay barrels and given extended lees contact. This is a creamy, leesy, rich wine, a very stylish blend that captures the citrusy Viognier, the floral Riesling and the rich, ripe, peachy Roussanne.",90,24,Washington,Yakima Valley,White Blend
"This Paso Robles-based winery has reached into cool-climate Edna Valley for their Chardonnay, with good results. The wine has good acidity and is dry and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors. Try with cracked crab and a well-buttered sourdough baguette.",90,18,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
"The winery began bottling a Roussanne only in 2001. Marching to its own distinct beat, this interesting wine is soft and full-bodied, with a creamy texture framing flavors of apricots, peaches and kiwi. It's dry and balanced.",90,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Roussanne
"Big, oaky and extremely bright, with refreshing acids and crisply defined fruit. As is usually the case with this spectacular vineyard, the flavors carry extra intensity; they seem to drill down into the heart of the palate. Though released young, this is a wine that could certainly benefit from another 6–12 months in the bottle.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Co-released with Curtis's Best Buy Heritage Cuvée, this wine, a blend of Grenache and Syrah, is very similar in its dry construction and forward fruit. Yet it's a little more tannic, and the oak seems more prominent. The flavors explode with cherries, blackberries, pomegranates, plums and mocha.",90,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Rhône-style Red Blend
"Here's a seriously good Chardonnay that fruit lovers will covet, but it's also enormously oaky. I like all that new French wood because the caramelly, smoky vanilla and buttered toast, which is boosted by total malolactic fermentation, works so well with the mangoes, papayas and pineapples. But I know people who would call this Chard toothpicky.",92,29,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Trutina, Dunham's Bordeaux blend, has long been the value wine in the Walla Walla superstar's portfolio. The 2004 is no exception, a seamless, silk-on-steel compendium of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wild card in '04 is the addition of 3% Syrah. It opens the wine up a bit, adding some spice and mint to the sweet cherry Merlot fruit. There's also an interesting grace note reminiscent of caraway cutting through.",91,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This exceptionally rich Sémillon is aged in neutral barrels. The fruit is firm and tart, showing a mix of pineapple and green citrus and berry. An underlying minerality adds texture and more firmness; the wine does not show excessive flesh, but is loaded with lovely acid and fruit, and a hint of toastiness in the finish. About one third comes from 25-year-old vines, some of the state's oldest Sémillon.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon
"Powerful yet restrained, this wine beautifully expresses the delicate and nuanced aspects of Cabernet Sauvignon with the herbal side of the grape in full force. Everything is tied together in a neat and tidy bundle, with sweet blackberry fruit surrounded by leaf and earth, leading into ripe but stiff tannins and just the right elements of mocha toast. Will it age? Undoubtedly; but hard not to drink it right now.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a thoroughly modern style: 100% French oak, Dijon Clone 75, plenty of lees contact. The yeasty nose introduces a very rich, mouthcoating sensation of butterscotch. Those leesy, creamy, butterscotch flavors surround the palate; the green apple fruit carries a bit of crisp authority and keeps the structure firm. Long, smooth and very sensual without being too tiring.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Yes it is 100% Gewürztraminer, and yes the winery calls it Port, listing the alcohol content at 19.5%. Unusual it certainly may be, but it is really quite well made, with varietal character showcasing very tasty candied citrus and sugared rose petals. The brandy is neither hot nor intrusive. All in all it's an intriguing, versatile and unique dessert wine.",90,21,Washington,Yakima Valley,Gewürztraminer
"Lodi produces hearty red wines so easily. This Petite Sirah is very dry and full-bodied, and pretty tannic, too, with ripe cherry, blackberry, coffee and bitter chocolate flavors that are edged with a little oak. It's a complex wine that's best now in its sheer, unadulterated youth.",90,27,California,Lodi,Petite Sirah
"Here is Viognier picked early enough to feature flavors of citrus rind rather than ripe peach. There is also a powerful herbal note, tasting of juniper and quinine, that lays down a spicy spine in the wine. All stainless, no malolactic; it's crisp, precise and laser-like in its focus.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
"All estate-grown, this cab franc has 12 percent petit verdot added into the blend. Deliciously crisp and bright, with cranberry and pomegranate red fruit flavors. The tannins are stiff and slightly chalky, and the wine finishes with hints of bitter baking chocolate. Give it some good breathing time to soften it up.",90,18,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"Yet another outstanding effort from Rulo, this appealing Chardonnay marries pretty peach flavors to a mix of spices from 100% French oak barrel fermentation. Cinnamon and other Asian spices, along with barrel toast, provide a nice counterpoint to the ripe fruit.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This new vintage of Novelty Hill's estate Chardonnay shows more acid and spice than the slightly richer, creamier 2005, but offers the same superb winemaking. The fruit is a perfect mix of apple, pear, passion fruit and green banana, laced with cinnamon and sweet baking spices. This is that all-too-rare, affordably-priced domestic Chardonnay. It does not require food to “fill in” what's missing—nothing is missing!",92,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This was one of the best Rieslings of the year last vintage, and the '07 is even better. It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years. Balancing that is a broad, complex array of citrus, peach, apple, flower, petrol, mineral and spice flavors. If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this.",92,24,California,Marin County,Riesling
"Here's a really good Merlot from a producer that does a great job at it and has kept prices fair for years. It shows the rich tannic structure that Napa so effortlessly achieves, while the great vintage ripened the grapes to blackberry and cherry perfection. Luscious now and for a couple more years.",92,28,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"This racy Cabernet is full of tart red fruits; its flavors are forward and lightly spicy. The wine seems to have been acidified, perhaps to provide some lift. It is a nicely focused effort; I like the way it gathers itself and holds that focus through a smooth, seamless, long finish.",90,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a delicious white Rhône-style blend, and you might try it as an alternative to Chardonnay. It's quite soft and silky, with a rich array of apricot, peach, honeysuckle and buttercream flavors that finish in a swirl of spicy complexity.",90,20,California,Sierra Foothills,Rhône-style White Blend
"Tart and sharp, with a pleasing tang and snap. The complex, clean and crisp flavors layer fig, citrus rind and clove with high notes of candied orange and citrus blossom. Great varietal character, cool-climate acidity; this is very sophisticated winemaking with spot-on flavors.",90,17,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sémillon
"Somewhat in the same tight, austere, guarded mode as the winery's Bordeaux blend, this cabernet franc breathes slowly into elegant complexity. Spicy, compact blue and red fruits are lightly accented with sweet spice.",90,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"Off-dry, with bright acids, this viscous and gloriously peachy Chenin reminds me of why I love this sadly neglected grape. Bursting with stone fruits, lively crisp acids, and softened by the residual fruit sugar and kissed with a streak of honey, it captures so much ripe, autumnal flavor in a single bottle.",90,10,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chenin Blanc
"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars. The cool site brings out some of the floral and citrus accents often missing from Merlot, and the darker cherry and plum fruit flavors fill in right behind. Supple and sensuous, this is a wine to savor and, if possible, cellar for another decade.",92,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc. Here is the same mix of racy, bracing tropical and stone fruit flavors, nicely matched to toasty flavors of almonds and biscuits. Elegant, detailed and ripe, yet clearly varietal, this is a beautiful, seductive example of barrel-fermented Washington Sauvignon Blanc.",92,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"Cab Franc is often chewy, tannic, herbal, but rarely luscious, as it is here. The addition of 12% Merlot softens up the middle, but the Franc is the show, with a dazzling display of blueberry, boysenberry, raspberry, coffee, tobacco leaf, lead pencil and more.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"A lovely Otis, now rounding out and showing pretty dried herb character throughout. There is a pleasing sweetness to the core of cherry/plum fruit, elevated with baking spices and lingering softly into the finish. The wine actually gathers strength in the back, adding in layers of caramel sprinkled with black pepper and dried sage. Drinking well now, it will surely keep for another decade or more.",91,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Displaying great fruit and excellent structure, this can be enjoyed now, but it has soon scale and intensity that we suggest aging it for at least another year or two. Barelli seems to yield darkly-fruited wines of depth and structure that read somewhat tighter and harder in their youth. Has classic cassis, toasty oak and tobacco touches, plus a dusty Alexander Valley feel.",91,28,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The really ripe dark cherry, toasty oak and licorice aromas and flavors here are winning. It has a wonderful sweetness and balance. The fruit here is rounder and more forward than in the Barelli—still, it's big, juicy and has plenty of structure.",91,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This tiny Walla Walla producer made just 220 cases of this Willow Crest Vineyard Syrah. It's a dazzling display of elegant power, offering polished red fruits with overtones of peach, apricot and candied orange. Finishes with a well-defined tannic edge nuanced with ash and smoke.",94,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah
"The primary source of this Zin is from Dry Creek Valley. It's rare to find this quality and quantity of upfront fruit in a Zin that's so balanced, but here it is. Massive raspberry, cherry, blackberry, mocha and Asian spice flavors, with buttery, smoky oak notes. Just delicious. Drink now.",93,25,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
"Those who loved Babcock's old Eleven Oaks bottling, don't worry. This is similar to it, but better. To counter Santa Rita's cool climate, Bryan Babcock put in some Los Alamos fruit, partially barrel fermented the wine, and added a dollop of Chardonnay to tame the beast. The wine is rich, zesty and balanced, and heads straight to the front of the pack.",92,21,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Sauvignon Blanc
"Delicious and refreshing, a dessert wine to have at the end of a great meal to revive the tastebuds. Zesty acidity frames mouthwateringly ripe tangerine, apricot honey, nectarine, vanilla and spice flavors.",92,12,California,Napa Valley,Muscat Canelli
"This brilliant PG has just a bit of older French oak on it, which adds softening cream, but the wine would be great even without it. The flavors of citrus zest, grapefruit sorbet, melons and figs are enormously rich and strong, and perfectly balanced by crisp acidity and a vibrant minerality leading to a dry, clean finish. What a great price for a wine of this stature.",91,16,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Gris
"This almost wins the white food wine of the year award. It's very dry, very crisp, and refreshingly clean, with balanced citrus zest, green melon, stony mineral and spicy pepper flavors. The acids really come into play on the finish. Let's eat!",91,15,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Grigio
"Doesn't say so on the label, but the wine comes from Kathy Joseph's Fiddlestix Vineyard, and the wine shows the property's clarity of acidity and wealth of berry and spice flavors. It's very dry, a fun wine yet a serious one too, and certainly among the best California rosés of the vintage.",91,15,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir
"This is quite a delicious Sauvignon, notable for its balance and elegance. Everything is understated, like fine tailoring. The flavors are food-friendly citrus zest, lemondrop, figs, melons and spicy green apples, and the finish totally dry.",90,17,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Another pure-blooded varietal from Robert Karl Cellars, this sappy, reductive syrah needs a lot of airing out. Tart fruit grudgingly shows spicy raspberry/cranberry flavors. Lots of acid, wrapped in vanilla and highlighted with sassafras. Tart, young and tight.",90,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Here's a rich, complex, savory Zin from the coolish south-central part of the valley. The vines were planted only in 2000, but the wine has the density of the old vine Zins that border the vineyard. The wild raspberry, coffee, cola and peppery spice flavors finish thoroughly dry, with rich tannins.",90,24,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
"This is the winery's French-oaked Syrah. It's smoky, focused and powerful, with sweet, cedary oak melded to dark, substantial fruit. The tannins are smooth and soft and lead into a creamy, caramel, layered finish. Full throttle, balanced and big.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"This is a 60/40 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, barrel fermented in 100% new French oak and aged on the lees with occasional batonnage. This rich, expansive, elegant, bone-dry white wine has wonderful intensity and layer upon layer of subtle spice. Polished fruit, light herbs, a seamless mouthfeel and a creamy, structured finish make this wine just about perfect. It's built for medium term aging, but why wait?",93,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend
"This is an almost magically delicious, ripe, alcoholic wine which packs plenty of punch but carries its weight with confidence and authority. Walla Walla's great 1999 grapes seem to effortlessly achieve an unbelievable balance of ripe, tropical fruit and firm, bracing acids. Add eight months in a mix of new and second-year French oak and you have a star. Editors' Choice.",93,22,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sémillon
"This wine is at the extreme end of the spectrum for Sémillon, and has an avid following as a result. Golden yellow in color, it shows ultraripe fruit that smells of apricots, peaches and pine. The fruit supports a lot of oak. Winemaker Marty Clubb has a great touch with this often-overlooked grape. As good as it is, the '99 still seems less complex than the spectacular '98.",92,22,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Sémillon
"The '98 Klipsun, from a premier vineyard on Red Mountain, is even better than the '97. It has a richness and ripeness in the cherry-flavored fruit, but retains the extra dimensions that Red Mountain soil imparts: flavors of iron, mineral and chalk. It's just a little hot in the finish, but not distractingly so. This is a very cleanly made wine, with no earthiness to it. As with all Seven Hills wines, it's built to age, though fine for near-term enjoyment. Editors' Choice.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Horse Heaven vineyard has been producing exceptional Sauvignon Blancs for the past decade. In this unusual vintage, which started very cool and lasted through an extended, late harvest, the grapes ripened to perfection. Ripe, lush fruit gets some added creaminess from barrel fermentation and aging sur lie. There are scents of lime, citrus peel, wet stone and spice, leading to a wonderfully full, focused panoply of flavors in the mouth. The finish goes on forever. Best Buy.",92,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"This 3,500-case boutique specializes in Merlot. The Yakima Valley bottling has a fine dark cast to it, and the fruit tends toward black cherry with extra dimensions of coffee, tobacco and smoke. There's a slight hint of earth here, too. The wine has dimension, depth and power, all in a precisely wound, tightly coiled style that says, “Age me!” Don't let the cheesy label fool you; this is seriously good Merlot. Editors' Choice.",92,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
"Another spectacular effort, though they've bumped up the price significantly. This is beautifully varietal, mixing floral, bath powder, apple and grapefruit components in both the nose and the mouth. There is an elegant intensity that powers the wine through an exceptionally long, brilliant finish; the residual sweetness keeps the alcohol down to 11.5% without making the wine either soft or sugary. 14,500 cases produced.",90,8,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Gewürztraminer
"Made Sancerre style, with no oak, this beautiful wine bursts with fresh citrus, honeydew, green grass, sweet pea and peppery spice flavors that stimulate the palate. It's so easy to drink, yet has the complexity to sustain interest. Try with raw shellfish or a salad of bitter greens, chevre, grapefruit and shrimp.",90,13,California,Sierra Foothills,Fumé Blanc
"Soft, complex and delicious, this Zin comes from mountain vineyards grown high above the fogs of Anderson Valley, where the sun ripens the grapes well. The wine is lush and complex, with black currant, mocha and spice flavors that are so ripe they suggest rum-soaked raisins.",90,25,California,Mendocino Ridge,Zinfandel
"Morgan has hit its stride with this unoaked Chardonnay. Nothing comes between the intense citrus, pineapple, white peach, apple and spice flavors and your palate. Cleansing acidity boosts it all and makes the wine star-bright. Morgan leads the pack of California unoaked Chards.",90,20,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
"One hundred percent barrel fermented and aged sur lies, this polished wine brings the same lemon and lime and grassy flavors as Brander's unoaked Au Naturel. But for me, the oak robs the wine of some of its crispness and brightness, although it's still a high-class Sauvignon Blanc.",90,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"This cool-climate variety loves it in the Sta. (formerly Santa) Rita Hills. High acidity creates a cool, cleansing feel, while the wine brims with citrus zest, pineapple meringue, mineral and vanilla flavors. This will send chefs into food-pairing heaven.",90,18,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Gris
"Very crisp in zesty acidity, bone dry, and with exotic flavors. This stony, minerally Chardonnay impresses for its firm structure. Flavorwise, it's explosive in lemons, limes, crunchy pears, Asian spices and buttery vanilla, even though it's unoaked. Showcases its terroir in a fine way.",90,21,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"Tight and still a bit closed down, this is a dark, compact, somewhat mysterious wine that keeps its cards close to its chest. Dig a little deeper than the clear, cassis fruit, and you'll find layers of subtlety, dark flavors of tar and licorice, hints of rock and iron, all wrapped in unyielding tannins. Let it breathe and the fruit begins to open up, and a softer, more elegant wine begins to emerge from its tough, tannic shell.",91,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Toast and smoke aromas entwine a solid core of blackberry fruit. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy without being soupy, thanks to a strong acid backbone that lends a tart edge to the flavors.",91,25,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
"Though it's the least expensive of Seven Hills' four Cabernets, this wine is just a step behind the others. There is good concentration in the color and in the nose, with cassis fruit pushing through a tight, compact structure. Fine balance with firm acids and some interesting mineral flavors, plus a hint of coffee in the finish. Editors' Choice.",90,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Future vintages of this wine will bear the new Red Mountain appellation, for that is where Klipsun is located. Waterbrook does the grapes proud: This is a juicy, ripe white wine bursting with scents and flavors of fresh fruits, cut grass, light spice and even some toasted coconut in the extended finish. Best Buy.",90,8,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
"Intense aromas of apples and pears start things off, and in the mouth the wine strikes just the right balance between intensity, crispness and full-flavored opulence. Good fruit, good acids, a pleasing creaminess, and an extended finish that lingers cleanly through flavors of toast and butter. Best Buy.",90,13,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"This top-of-the-line Chardonnay from Columbia Crest gets extra time in barrel and bottle, and comes from the much-heralded 1998 vintage. It's a rich, creamy style, with less obvious buttery oak than the Grand Estates, but more complexity and a thicker, more complex feel to it. Flavors mix fruit, wood, spice and herb evenly. It has a comforting feeling of weight to it; it's not just up-front, aggressive flavors. Editors' Choice.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Very pale in color, with a slight coppery sheen and pronounced aromas of strawberry. It's very rich in the mouth, just loaded with fruity, spicy personality. Not quite dry, with just a trace of sugar. There's a nice creaminess to this crowd-pleasing sparkler.",90,27,California,Mendocino County,Champagne Blend
"Klipsun fruit is known for its firm tannins, iron and mineral elements, dark fruit and sturdy ageworthiness. Here a touch of the barnyard in the bouquet brings it ever closer to Bordeaux. It's a complex wine, which, despite its youth, shows a wonderful range of flavors, from black cherry to coffee to steel and smoke. The iron and acids and tannin are there to age, but it drinks beautifully right now, so why wait? Just 138 cases made.",90,29,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spicy and detailed, layered with sweet grass and lemon meringue. Shows wonderful dry extract, dense and complex, with terrific midpalate concentration and exceptional length and viscosity. Focused and fragrant, it goes into the deep, bold flavors of the best Washington Sémillon.",94,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend
"This bottling, which is Randall Grahm's hommage to the Northern Rhône, has varied over the vintages, but with this 2006, hits the mark as never before. Made with a splash of Grenache, it's full-bodied, bone dry and compelling in the intricacy of flavors. The blackberries, black cherries, licorice, and raspberries have elements of roasted meats and wild mushrooms sautéed in butter, tamari and a few drops of balsamic, liberally dusted with black pepper. Unique and compelling, and should develop over the next six years.",93,20,California,Central Coast,Syrah
"All estate-grown and barrel fermented, this ripe and delicious white wine opens with scents of sweet hay, then is quickly wrapped in flavors of lemon zest, grapefruit and candied citrus. There's a dusty note as well, and the richness keeps bringing in more nuances—of English Breakfast tea, sweet stone fruits and lightly tropical papaya. Supple, round and luscious, it has excellent length and a clean exit.",93,18,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Sauvignon Blanc
"A quality Bordeaux blend, nicely fleshed out with Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc components. Fine spices focus the core of raspberry and black cherry, and there's a suggestion of cola running through the finish.",90,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"Just delicious. Packed with superrich and refined Viognier flavors of pineapple and mango chutney, apricot honey, vanilla and spices, the wine is dry and creamy, with brisk, refreshing acidity. Perfect for a cocktail sipper.",90,17,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Viognier
"Deeply colored, almost black, with plummy edges, this wine sends out layers of scents: black fruits, coffee, smoke, pencil shavings and ash. I like the confident way it sets up in the mouth, firm but not closed, tannic but not chalky, dark but not bitter. Everything is in balance, and the flavors mingle seamlessly. A wonderful example of the Bordeaux-like qualities that many of the best Washington Cabernets possess.",90,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Charbonneau is Woodward Canyon's proprietary name for its white and red blended wines. The blanc is predominantly Sémillon, with 10% Sauvignon Blanc added to round it out. The nose is scented with freshly mown hay, spice and herbs. It has plenty of crisp fruit in the mouth, and a distinctive spiciness that begs to be paired with Thai food, crab cakes or something with cilantro. Great food wine.",90,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),White Blend
"The blend here is 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot and 22% Cabernet Franc. The wine is dark, dense, what some call “brooding.” It is firm and tart up front, but stuffed with layers of oak and herb and cherry/berry flavor. It's too clean to be Bordeaux, too tart to be Californian; it's a classic, Columbia Valley style Washington Cabernet, built to last.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend
"A beautiful Chardonnay with so much class and elegance, it's a bargain at this price. Shows lush flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, Meyer lemon custard and vanilla sorbet, balanced with crisp acidity and a fine touch of smoky oak. Perfect with shellfish.",92,24,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"A lovely Chardonnay, dry, elegant and minerally. Displays real control, with the pineapple, lemondrop candy, apricot and oak flavors balanced by crisp acidity. Easily as good as Chards costing far more, which makes it a value.",92,21,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
"Dry Creek Vineyard keeps turning out the most drinkable, delicious Cabernets, at such a good price, and hardly anyone notices. Why? Because it's not from Napa. This wine is soft and rich, with briary blackberry, dark chocolate, coffee and spice flavors that finish completely dry. A sophisticated wine.",90,21,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Take your average oaky Napa cult Cab, strip away the bells and whistles that make it, rather than food, the star at the table, and what you get is this balanced, elegant Cab. Gary Eberle has spent a lifetime figuring out how to make a wine like this, and food-loving wine drinkers are the beneficiaries.",90,29,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich and oaky, with lavish flavors of vanilla custard, smoky meringue and créme brulée. The fruit consists of ripe pineapples and Meyer lemons.",92,29,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"This is all Sundance vineyard, beautifully executed. It's got a ton of character, intensity, and brilliant, bright fruit. The acids are natural and flavors run through the citrus spectrum, from lime to pineapple, with great persistence.",92,20,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Chardonnay
"Tank sample, 100% estate, May 1 '09 release. 180 cases; winery only. An unusually bright and racy style, with plenty of natural acidity, fresh lime and citrus, hints of white peach and a refreshing minerality. This is a glorious springtime white wine; you can almost taste the flowers. The impression of lime and citrus is immaculate and without any bitterness.",92,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Viognier
"Voluptuous, with decadently rich flavors of cassis, blackberry pie filling, red licorice, milk chocolate, black pepper and cedar flavors. Shows enough acidity and tannin structure for balance. Drink now.",92,29,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah
"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc that shows classic Napa balance, with a savory crispness that invites pairing with goat cheese, grilled veggies or roasted halibut. Dry and tart, it's rich in pineapple juice, pink grapefruit, fig, green melon, honeysuckle, vanilla and pepper flavors.",92,26,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine. It cleanses the mouth with scoury flavors of lychee, lime, nectarine, minerals and peppery nasturtium, with a foresty, resinous quality suggesting pine cone.",91,20,California,Monterey County,Albariño
"With different vineyard sources and blend from the excellent 2006, this is still a clear improvement, with true varietal character. White pepper, clove, herb, earth and still-sharp, angular berry fruit; fading into baking chocolate finish. The listed alcohol remains under 14%.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"They say the vines average 80 years of age, which means who knows where those old roots have explored. For that matter, who knows what the grape varieties really are. The wine is the least fruity of the winery's current Zins. While it shows berry-cherry and licorice flavors, it's notable for hard-to-describe earthy, mineral and mushroomy tastes that are interesting and unique.",91,28,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
"From the oldest (1983 vintage) estate vines, this is finished off-dry, about 1.7% residual sugar. Off-dry or not, it's succulent and spicy, mixing melon, apple and citrus with some sweeter notes hinting at honey. Good length and a crisp finish.",91,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
"Tight, taut and lemony, a Chablis-like Chardonnay of extreme dryness and minerality. Shows mouthwatering flavors of flint, Meyer lemons and limes, with a touch of smoky oak. Very fine and elegant, a beautiful Chardonnay that will support, not overwhelm, food.",91,29,California,Napa,Chardonnay
"This extremely sweet wine has flavors of cherries, blackberries, raspberries, dark chocolate, coconut macaroon and vanilla custard, with rich tannins and a crisp spine of tangerine acidity. It's totally, decadently delicious.",94,20,California,Paso Robles,Sangiovese
"The outstanding Elerding vineyard provided the fruit in 2006. From the opening whiff of dried spice, fresh herb, pepper and earth, it opens into a rich palate stocked with wild fruits, moist earth, coffee grounds and leafy forest floor materials. If you enjoy your Syrah on the wild side, you will want a bottle of this.",90,26,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Syrah
"A lovely bottle, loaded with textures of moist earth and herb. The fruit is tart and spicy, the flavors compact and persistent, with streaks of blueberry and black cherry, light chocolate and earth. Still a little rugged in the finish, it shows some unresolved bacon fat and green herb streaks.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah
"Very rich and full-bodied, very voluptuous, this soft wine shows massive tiers of well-ripened black currant, plum sauce, mocha and cedar flavors. Appealing now for the opulence, but it's a little primary, and should develop bottle character after winter, 2009.",90,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This belongs up there with Walla Walla's best Sangioveses (Leonetti, Walla Walla Vintners). From the outstanding Morrison Lane vineyard, it's a plush, toasty wine whose strawberry fruit is matched and balanced against toast, vanilla and tobacco. The mouthfeel is generous and somehow crunchy.",90,26,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sangiovese
"If you're a Petite Sirah fan you'll love the richness and power of this one, from an appellation in Lake County. It's dry and softly tannic, and notable for an explosion of blackberries, cassis, plums, chocolate, anise, black pepper and sandalwood.",90,20,California,High Valley,Petite Sirah
"A dense, balanced Syrah that amply displays a complex mix of ripe fruits, hinting at raisins and spice, but not overloaded with either. The spice-cake impression continues on, adding layers of coffee and toast, then introducing moist earth and a bit of dried herb.",90,25,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah
"Very spicy, with an intense bouquet of toast, seed and pungent herb. Rich and fruity in the mouth, it's a complex mix of melon, passion fruit, papaya, guava and sweet orange. The fruit salad rolls back into oaky, buttery flavors for a full-throttle finish. Another 15.5% effort from Airfield, but here the fruit can stand up to the barrels.",90,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay-Viognier
"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one in quantity. Easy to find, with 45,000 cases produced.",90,13,California,Mendocino County,Chardonnay
"What a great Syrah for twenty bucks. It's as dry, full-bodied and peppery as a fine Northern Rhône bottling, with impressively deep flavors of sour black cherries, plums, violets and cedar. An outstandingly good buy, but only 174 cases produced.",90,20,California,Edna Valley,Syrah
"The underlying fruit smacks of lemon curd, peach pie and kumquats, with a keen, cold minerality. Well-charred oak and lees contribute the richest notes of butterscotch, vanilla and toast. Dry, crisp and elegant, this is one of the best Dry Creek Valley Chards I've ever tasted, but it's still not in the league of the best cool-climate bottlings.",92,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Chardonnay
"Brings a boutique touch to this often rustic variety, with a classic structure, although no Petite Sirah can ever quite escape its brawny bulk. Nor should it want to. Blackberries, black currants, loganberries, plums, cherries, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, coffee, violets—they all come together in this dry, fresh young wine. Will easily hold for a decade or two, gradually getting softer and sweeter.",92,28,California,Napa Valley,Petite Sirah
"From a venerable Burgundian producer comes this earthy, spicy wine, with a body and texture that are unctuous and creamy. There's a whole fruit basket here, with everything from green apples to peaches to tropical fruit. What's harder to express is the wine's power to satisfy. Rich and lush, it swings for the bleachers and just misses, but it's a solid triple. Editors' Choice.",91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Ripe and racy, this single-vineyard wine has lots of sweet lime, white peach and kiwi aromas and flavors on top of a steely framework of crisp acidity. Oak adds buttery, creamy notes. A rich, complex combination.",91,20,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
"Too bad some people have eyes only for Chardonnay, when a wonderful dry white wine like this is available. Made from the “Musque” clone and farmed by the family that owns Flora Springs, it veers toward citrus fruits and a pleasant splash of buttery, honeyed toast. Elegant and limpid in the mouth. Editors' Choice.",91,18,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Made with fully ripened grapes, this is a lush, complex, thoroughly enjoyable wine. It's fairly dry by California standards, but offers up masses of sweet fruit and oak extract. The balance is especially nice; all parts are in harmony. Editors' Choice.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
"The deep, dark red color and richly ripe fruit and berry aromas tell you just how fine the grapes got in this wonderful vintage. The essence of plums and blackberries jumps out of the glass. Full and rich; those who think Monterey can't ripen a Bordeaux varietal just might be surprised. Yes, it's a little soft, and don't look for rich, complex tannins like you find in the North Coast. But this is a deeply satisfying, serious red wine.",90,18,California,Monterey,Merlot
"They call this their Alsatian-style wine, and indeed, it contains smaller amounts of Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Sylvaner. This explains the pretty flavors, which range from citrus and straw through flowers and lusher spices and fruits. Yet it's very dry and crisp and finishes tart and racy. Editors' Choice.",90,15,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Angeline is one of the best second labels in California, in this case from Martin Ray. This '08 Sauvignon smacks of ripe, tangy Asian pear, gooseberry, fig, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors brightened by wonderfully crisp acidity. Just beautiful, and a nice bargain at this price.",90,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"With a little Petite Sirah and Carignane added for complexity, this is a beautiful Zinfandel meant for drinking now. It has fresh, zesty flavors of wild raspberries, cherries, blueberries and red currants, with notes of licorice, cocoa and pepper. Notable new oak adds even richer elements of vanilla and smoke.",90,28,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
"Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.",90,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Really nice, fragrant and floral with lovely clover and peach highlights. It's dusty and elegant, a truly stylish and very affordable Chardonnay. There's just a bit of sharpness in the finish, gently fading into toast.",90,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"An outstanding example of Washington Merlot. It needs more bottle age, but has all the right stuffing. There is plenty of still-to-be-integrated new oak, toast, and a dark and earthy core. Note that the Loess (Leonetti) vineyard contributes to the blend. Decant this; it could be a real sleeper.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
"These old vines were planted in 1973, producing a graceful wine that just hints at more subtle notes under the primary fruit and new oak. Mixed red berry, currant and cherry flavors run into stiff tannins; with airing it opens out, revealing the brambly wild-fruit flavors of old vines, and introducing mocha and caramel.",90,28,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Cabernet
"Ripe and spicy, this is a very rich and fruity Gewürz, with moderate sweetness (1.6% residual sugar). Melon, mango, candied orange peel dominate, it's round and tasty, without the soapy or oily quality of the variety.",90,14,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Gewürztraminer
"A fine, dry Sauvignon Blanc, dry and crisp in acidity, with flavors of lemons and limes, figs, vanilla, honeysuckle and a nice tangy streak of lemongrass. No oak was applied, but the richness of lees shows in the buttercream.",90,16,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc
"This is one of the best rosés in California. It's totally dry, crisply acidic and delicately structured, with subtle, complex flavors that run from cherries, cranberries and rose petals to dried herbs and peppery Asian spice. Hats off to consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs for mastering the essence of rosé.",91,20,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir
"Well-made and fancy, this wine is elegant, rather than a blockbuster. They didn't go for enough extract to choke a horse, so the wine is light and airy on the palate, but by no means simple. There's plenty of currant and blackberry fruit and oak. It's a “feminine” wine; not the kind that wins blind tastings, but a food wine you drink with delight. Editors' Choice.",90,18,California,Carneros,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft and juicy, with a lot of sweet, ripe, up-front fruit flavors, including blueberries. Deft and supple, with elegant, modulated tannins and low acidity. Creamy and rich, this is a very pleasant, fruit-driven wine that offers solid enjoyment. Editors' Choice.",90,18,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Franc
"Comes down on the lemony side, but not aggressively so. The citrus is balanced with creamy, oaky, herbal notes that soften and add complexity. Dry, with a great deal of lemon-and-lime extract, slightly soft, but very elegant. This is a stylish wine, exceptionally well balanced, and one of the better Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"Backed up by a fine structure of tangy acidity and rich, ripe tannins, this Cab shows a fine complexity of flavor. Blackberries, black currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, plums, anise, raisins and pepper mingle on the palate, leading to a long, distinguished finish.",90,22,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's supple, lightly spicy and svelte—it has the sleekness of a fine racehorse, and runs across the palate at a confident gallop. Brambly, elegant and nuanced with herb and ripe stone fruits, with poise and balance to burn.",90,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
"A really nice Sauvignon Blanc. Fundamentally dry, but rich in fruity extract, it shows crisp, creamy flavors of pineapples, limes, sweet Meyer lemons, vanilla and smoky oak, girded by a firm minerality. Shows how well the cool Russian River Valley can treat this variety.",90,26,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
"A terrific wine whose slight residual sugar of 0.8% is balanced by crisp Monterey acidity that's so firm, the wine finishes dry. Teases the palate with tangerines, Mandarin orange blossom, bosc pears, honeysuckle and vanilla, undergirded by a stony minerality.",90,18,California,Monterey County,Muscat
"This is the first vintage for Cab Franc as a varietal wine from Gamache. A lot of blueberry and black cherry shows through, along with generous barrel flavors of smoke and toast. It's got winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark chocolate, followed with round flavors of vanilla and tobacco, and tannins tasting of tea and earth.",90,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
"The '06 was a 16% monster, but delicious. The '07 is just as good, but swings less of a hammer. Alcohol is 14.8%, yet the wine comes across as the concentrated essence of raspberries and cherries, lifted with all-natural acids, and showing a piercing core that just keeps on going.",90,26,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Zinfandel
"Lovely mountain Zin, showing a briary, brambly quality to intensely flavored wild blackberries, blueberries and cherry liqueur. There also are tiers of peppery spices, licorice, chocolate mint and soy. Polished and dry, this fine, complex Zinfandel is drinking well now.",91,20,California,Fiddletown,Zinfandel
"Dark in color and full-bodied for a rosé, this dry wine is enormously concentrated in the ripest, sweetest red and black cherries. Turns increasingly complex in the mouth, showing layers of anise, vanilla and spice.",90,14,California,Santa Barbara County,Rosé
"What a roll Fess Parker Winery is on with their '08 Chardonnays. Not only great wine, but priced so well. This wine, sourced from Parker's U Block in this famous Santa Maria Valley vineyard, is as rich as any Chardonnay of the vintage—just massive in pineapple, pear and buttered toast flavors. Yet it's crisp and tart, clean and bracing in its minerality. Only 115 cases produced.",96,28,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
"This is all Birch Creek vineyard, barrel fermented, 100% malo, about one third new wood, one third one year, the rest neutral. It's a soft, fleshy, buttery, California style, but nothing overblown. There's plenty of new oak flavor, good ripe fruit, and enough acid to support the yellow apple and melon fruit.",90,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Chardonnay
"Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.",90,22,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"From warm, dry vineyards in the eastern Vaca mountains, this Zin, which is one-quarter Petite Sirah, is ultrarich and smooth in blackberry, cassis, raspberry and mocha flavors, with a complex dash of Provençal herbs. It's quite a good Zin, made in the style of a dry, balanced Cab or Merlot.",90,24,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
"Nice and smooth for this sometimes boring variety, with a lush texture and appealingly dry flavors of blackberries, violets, mocha and coconut macaroon cookie, and an almond skin bitterness in the finish. The tannins are there, rich and sturdy, offering a firm counterbalance to the ripeness.",90,25,California,Paso Robles,Barbera
"Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear purée. Aged in 40% new French oak, California Chardonnay hardly gets any better than this.",95,28,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
"A Syrah of considerable proportions, made in the Novy style of power and ripeness. It's suprising that Novy didn't priced it higher, as it has that extractive richness and inherent wealth of texture that are the domain of expensive red wines. Just tremendous in blackberries, chocolate and spices, with the most beautiful tannins. Drink now, with the finest meats.",94,29,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah
"Here's a very dry, steely and streamlined Chardonnay. Brims with mineral-infused pineapple tart, buttered toast and honey flavors. Feels wonderfully elegant and balanced, and will pair beautifully with barbecued salmon. The vineyard is located on the so-called Santa Maria bench, one of the region's prime growing areas.",94,27,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
"Beautiful PG, one of the better ones out there, and the kind of wine that's driving the category through the roof. Absolutely dry, elegantly crisp and minerally-fruity, it defines elegance. The flavors veer toward limes and grapefruits and riper, lusher tropical fruits and white flowers.",90,20,California,Mendocino County,Pinot Gris
"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
"Albariño is turning into my favorite dry white wine. It's what Pinot Gris/Grigio claimed to be, and so often isn't. This one's really dry and acidic, with really minerally citrus flavors. Bring on the salty tapas.",90,18,California,Carneros,Albariño
